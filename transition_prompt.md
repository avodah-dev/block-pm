## Active Handoff Notes

### Context
Just completed comprehensive EFS generation and requirement traceability analysis:
- Generated 13 epics, 40 features, 160 stories from 9 workflows
- Created requirement traceability matrix showing 87.3% coverage
- Moved traceability matrix from drafts to `/02-analysis/requirements/`
- Updated all _info.md files to reflect current state

### Next Session Focus: Initial Review Planning
The next session should focus on determining how to conduct stakeholder review of the generated epics/features/stories.

**Key Files to Review**:
1. `/03-outputs/drafts/epics-features-stories-summary.md` - The complete EFS breakdown
2. `/02-analysis/requirements/requirement-traceability-matrix.md` - Coverage analysis
3. `/04-operations/templates/story-attributes.md` - Template for story attributes (if exists)

**Decisions Needed**:
1. **Review Format**: How should stakeholders review 160 stories?
   - CSV export for spreadsheet review?
   - Grouped by epic for focused sessions?
   - Online markdown with commenting?

2. **Story Enrichment**: What attributes to add before review?
   - Persona assignment (P01-Buyer, P02-Vendor, P03-Integrated)
   - Architecture layer (Product vs Business Logic)
   - Phase assignment (MVP, Phase 2, Future)
   - Story point estimates (1, 2, 3, 5, 8)

3. **Gap Handling**: How to address the 15 uncovered requirements?
   - Create stories for warranty management
   - Defer low-priority gaps
   - Get stakeholder input on importance

**Recommended Approach**:
Consider creating a simplified review format that groups stories by epic and shows:
- Story ID and one-line description
- Requirement(s) covered
- Suggested phase
- Space for stakeholder comments

This would be more manageable than reviewing 160 individual stories.

## Procedure

2. Act on any instructions present
3. Clear contents or mark as "REVIEWED [date]" after completion
