# Story Enrichment Task

## Purpose
Transform basic user stories into fully-attributed specifications with acceptance criteria, traceability, technical notes, and all metadata required for development and tracking. This enrichment enables proper project management, requirement verification, and implementation planning.

## Input Requirements
1. **Epic Detail Document**: Path to epic detail file (e.g., e01-request-management.md)

4. **Workflow Documentation**: Access to /03-outputs/workflows/ for process context
5. **Project Dictionary**: Access to /04-operations/architecture/project_dictionary.md

## Output Specifications

### File Naming Convention
- Pattern: `e##-[epic-name]-full.md` (e.g., e01-request-management-full.md)
- Location: /03-outputs/drafts/ for review, then /03-outputs/epics/ when finalized

## Processing Instructions

### Step 1: Story Attribute Assignment

#### Persona Selection
Map each story to appropriate persona:
- P01-Buyer: Procurement/purchasing activities
- P02-Vendor: Supplier/vendor activities
- P03-Integrated-Vendor: Dual-role capabilities
- P04-Admin: System administration (if needed)
- System Process: Automated/backend processes

#### Architecture Layer Determination
Assign primary layer(s) where work occurs:
- `sw-frontend`: UI components, user interactions
- `sw-backend`: Business logic, API endpoints
- `bl-frontend`: Block-specific UI customizations
- `bl-backend`: Block-specific integrations
- `data`: Database schema, data operations
- `external`: Third-party integrations
- `cross-layer`: Spans multiple layers equally

#### Priority Assignment
Based on requirement importance:
- P0 (Critical): Core marketplace functionality, blockers
- P1 (High): Important features, major workflows
- P2 (Medium): Enhancements, nice-to-have features
- P3 (Low): Future considerations, optimizations

#### Phase Determination
- Phase 1: MVP core functionality, must-have features
- Phase 2: Enhancements, remaining features, optimizations

#### Story Point Estimation
Using Fibonacci scale:
- 1 point: Trivial change, <2 hours
- 2 points: Simple story, <1 day
- 3 points: Standard story, 1-2 days
- 5 points: Complex story, 2-3 days
- 8 points: Very complex, 3-5 days
- 13 points: Should probably be split

### Step 2: Acceptance Criteria Development

Generate 5-7 specific, testable criteria per story:
1. **Functional Requirements**: What the system must do
2. **User Experience**: How users interact with the feature
3. **Data Requirements**: What data is captured/validated
4. **Performance Requirements**: Speed, scale, reliability
5. **Edge Cases**: Error handling, boundary conditions
6. **Security/Compliance**: Access control, audit requirements
7. **Integration Requirements**: How it works with other systems

Format: Active voice, measurable outcomes
- Good: "System validates part numbers within 2 seconds"
- Bad: "Part numbers should be validated quickly"

### Step 3: Traceability Enhancement

#### Requirements Traceability
For each story:
1. Identify all related requirement IDs
2. Fetch full requirement text from source files
3. Include complete requirement description
4. Explain how story addresses requirement
5. Note any partial coverage or variations

Format:
```markdown
**Requirements**:
- **SWP-M-10**: "Material / Part search (Customer must be able to search for a PN or description and click 'Select' to add to a material Request List)"
  - This story implements the part number search capability with fuzzy matching
  - Addresses the formatting variation challenge mentioned in discovery
```

#### Workflow Traceability
1. Identify related workflows
2. Reference specific workflow steps
3. Explain story's role in workflow

Format:
```markdown
**Workflows**:
- **W01**: Buyer Parts Request Workflow - Step W01-S02 (Search for Part)
  - This story enables the search functionality used in this step
```

### Step 4: Technical Notes Addition

Include relevant technical considerations:
- Algorithm choices (e.g., "Use Levenshtein distance for fuzzy matching")
- Performance optimizations (e.g., "Index normalized part numbers")
- Integration dependencies (e.g., "Requires Salesforce API access")
- Security considerations (e.g., "Implement rate limiting")
- Architecture decisions (e.g., "Use event-driven updates")

### Step 5: Implementation Roadmap

Add section after all stories:
```markdown
## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1 Sprint Allocation
- Sprint 1: [Story IDs] (Foundation)
- Sprint 2: [Story IDs] (Core features)
- Sprint 3: [Story IDs] (Integration)

### Technical Dependencies
- [List key dependencies]

### Integration Points
- [List system integrations]

### Success Metrics
- [Specific, measurable targets]
```

## Enrichment Rules

### Consistency Requirements
1. All stories in a feature share the same epic
2. Personas align with story actions
3. Priorities cascade appropriately (critical epic = high priority stories)
4. Phase assignments align with dependencies
5. Story points reflect relative complexity

### Completeness Requirements
1. Every story has all required attributes
2. At least 5 acceptance criteria per story
3. Traceability to requirements OR workflows (or both)
4. Technical notes where implementation isn't obvious
5. Full requirement text included, not just IDs

### Quality Standards
1. Acceptance criteria are specific and testable
2. Requirements show clear alignment
3. Technical notes add value (not generic)
4. Story points are realistic
5. Personas match the story actor

## Domain Language Consistency

Maintain Block terminology throughout:
- Use "requisition" for formal requests
- Use "material" for Salesforce items
- Use "part" for physical components
- Use "modality" for equipment types
- Use "EMA" for messaging system
- Use "raw part number" for normalized format

## Example Transformation

### Input (Basic Story)
```markdown
S001: Implement parts search with fuzzy matching and raw part number normalization
```

### Output (Enriched Story)
```markdown
#### S001: Implement parts search with fuzzy matching and raw part number normalization

**Story ID**: S001
**Persona**: P01-Buyer
**Architecture Layer**: sw-backend, sw-frontend
**Epic**: E01-REQUEST-MANAGEMENT
**Feature**: F01-Parts-Database-Search
**Priority**: P0 (Critical)
**Phase**: Phase 1
**Story Points**: 5

**Description**:
As a buyer, I want to search for parts using partial or differently formatted part numbers so that I can find what I need regardless of how vendors format their part numbers. The system should apply Block's raw part number normalization automatically and suggest close matches when exact matches aren't found.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Search accepts part numbers with or without hyphens, spaces, or leading zeros
- System automatically applies raw part number normalization algorithm
- Fuzzy matching returns results within 2-3 character variations
- Search results show match confidence percentage
- Results prioritize exact matches, then normalized, then fuzzy
- Search completes within 2 seconds for 100,000+ parts
- System logs all searches for pattern analysis

**Traceability**:

**Requirements**:
- **SWP-M-10**: "Material / Part search (Customer must be able to search for a PN or description and click 'Select' to add to a material Request List)"
  - This story directly implements the part number search capability

**Workflows**:
- **W01**: Buyer Parts Request Workflow - Step W01-S02 (Search for Part)

**Technical Notes**:
- Implement Levenshtein distance algorithm for fuzzy matching
- Create indexed normalized_part_number column for performance
- Consider caching frequent search results
- Raw part number formula: remove non-alphanumeric, trim leading zeros, uppercase
```
