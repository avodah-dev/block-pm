# Architecture Folder Documentation

## Purpose
Contains overarching architectural guidelines, system design principles, and reference materials that define the technical foundation of the project. These documents provide the architectural context and principles that guide all implementation decisions within the structured project hierarchy.

## Core Documents

### architecture_layers.md
- **Purpose**: Defines system boundaries and architectural layers
- **Scope**: Product Layer vs Business Logic vs Business Systems
- **Key Concepts**: Separation of concerns, integration boundaries
- **Usage**: Guide architectural decisions and component placement
- **Audience**: Architects, senior developers, system designers

### discovery_pain_points_summary.md
- **Purpose**: Consolidated findings from discovery sessions
- **Content**: User pain points, workflow inefficiencies, opportunities
- **Source**: Three days of discovery session analysis
- **Usage**: Justify feature priorities and design decisions
- **Audience**: Product managers, stakeholders, development team

### project_dictionary.md
- **Purpose**: Common terminology and concept definitions
- **Content**: Domain terms, abbreviations, system concepts
- **Structure**: Alphabetical glossary with context
- **Usage**: Ensure consistent understanding across team
- **Audience**: All team members, especially new joiners

## Relationships to Other Folders

### Informs All Folders
These architectural documents provide foundational context for:
- `/03-outputs/workflows/`: Business process understanding
- `/03-outputs/epics/`, `/03-outputs/features/`, `/03-outputs/stories/`: Development priorities and technical constraints
- `/02-analysis/requirements/`: Requirement interpretation within architectural boundaries
- `/01-sources/client-requirements/`: Context for requirements

### Updated Based On
- `/01-sources/transcripts/`: Discovery session insights
- `/02-analysis/requirements/`: Gap analysis findings
- Implementation learnings from `/03-outputs/`
- Stakeholder feedback

## Usage Patterns

### For New Team Members
1. Start with `project_dictionary.md` for terminology
2. Read `architecture_layers.md` for system overview
3. Review `discovery_pain_points_summary.md` for context

### For Design Decisions
1. Reference architecture layers for boundaries
2. Check pain points for user needs
3. Validate against conceptual models
4. Ensure terminology consistency

### For Stakeholder Communication
1. Use pain points to justify changes
2. Reference architecture for technical decisions
3. Apply consistent terminology from dictionary

## Key Insights from Documents

### Architecture Principles
- Clear separation between product and business logic
- Vendor-agnostic product layer
- Block-specific business system layer
- Integration through defined interfaces

### Discovery Themes
- Manual processes consuming 60% of buyer time
- Vendors managing 5-7 different portals
- Excel as primary tool for 80% of workflows
- Communication gaps causing delays

### Domain Concepts
- Sourcing Window (SW): Vendor-facing platform
- Sourcing Window Platform (SWP): Buyer-facing platform
- Integrated Vendor: Block as middleman supplier
- Auto-sourcing: Automated vendor selection

## Document Maintenance

### Update Triggers
- Major architectural decisions
- New discovery insights
- Terminology evolution
- Strategic pivots

### Review Frequency
- Quarterly for architecture documents
- After each discovery phase
- When onboarding new team members
- Before major releases

## Quality Standards
- **Clarity**: Concepts explained simply
- **Completeness**: Cover all major themes
- **Currency**: Reflect latest understanding
- **Consistency**: Aligned terminology and principles
- **Accessibility**: Understandable to intended audience

## Future Additions
Potential reference documents to add:
- Integration patterns guide
