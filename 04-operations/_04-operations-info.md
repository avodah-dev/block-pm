# 04-Operations Directory

## Purpose
This directory contains the operational framework that supports the requirements management system - the processes, tools, templates, and architectural decisions that enable effective project execution.

## Directory Structure
```

├── architecture/          # Technical architecture and system design decisions
├── processes/            # Agent tasks, scripts, and operational procedures
└── templates/            # Standardized document templates
```

## Subdirectories

### architecture/
Technical system design and architectural decision documentation.
- **System Architecture**: High-level design patterns and technology choices
- **Integration Points**: How different system components connect
- **Scalability Considerations**: Performance and growth planning
- **Security Framework**: Authentication, authorization, and data protection
- **Technology Stack**: Approved tools and platforms

### processes/
Operational procedures and automation tools.
- **Agent Tasks**: LLM-powered automation scripts for routine work
- **Scripts**: Utility scripts for data processing and system maintenance
- **Completed Tasks**: Archive of finished operational procedures
- **Standard Procedures**: Repeatable processes for common activities

### templates/
Standardized document formats ensuring consistency across all outputs.
- **Document Templates**: Markdown templates for requirements, features, stories
- **JSON Schemas**: Structured data formats for indices and matrices
- **Process Templates**: Standard workflows for common tasks
- **Communication Templates**: Stakeholder reporting and status update formats

## Operational Framework

### Key Architectural Principle
Clear separation between:
- **Product Layer**: Clean, vendor-agnostic marketplace (any company could use)
- **Business Logic Layer**: Block's proprietary features and competitive advantages

This principle guides all technical decisions and system design.

### Process Automation
- **LLM Agents**: Automated requirement extraction and analysis
- **Data Processing**: Batch operations for large document sets
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated validation of document relationships
- **Reporting**: Scheduled generation of status and coverage reports

### Template System
Standardized formats ensure:
- **Consistency**: All documents follow same structure and conventions
- **Traceability**: Required fields enforce relationship tracking
- **Quality**: Built-in validation prevents incomplete specifications
- **Efficiency**: Faster document creation with pre-defined formats

## Current Operational Status

### Architecture
- **Platform Evolution**: Transitioning from SW 2.0 (Salesforce) to modern platform
- **Design Patterns**: Clean architecture with clear layer separation
- **Technology Decisions**: Modern web stack with API-first design

### Process Maturity
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive scaffolding system implemented
- **Automation**: Basic LLM-powered analysis and generation
- **Quality Control**: Manual review processes with template enforcement
- **Workflow**: Established patterns for requirement → analysis → development

### Template Coverage
- **Requirements**: Full templates for CAD and RRD documents
- **Development**: Epic, Feature, Story templates with traceability
- **Analysis**: Gap analysis and coverage report templates
- **Process**: Agent task and script documentation templates

## Integration Points

### With Source Materials (`/01-sources/`)
- **Data Extraction**: Processes for parsing requirement documents
- **Transcript Analysis**: LLM agents for discovery session processing
- **Version Control**: Change tracking for evolving requirements

### With Analysis (`/02-analysis/`)
- **Automated Gap Analysis**: Scripts for coverage calculation
- **Traceability Validation**: Checks for broken requirement links
- **Report Generation**: Automated status and progress reports

### With Outputs (`/03-outputs/`)
- **Template Enforcement**: All outputs use standardized formats
- **Quality Gates**: Validation before documents move from draft to final
- **Cross-Reference Checking**: Automated relationship validation

## Key Operational Processes

### Session Management
- **Handoff Procedures**: Clean transitions between work sessions
- **Context Preservation**: Maintaining state across extended work
- **Progress Tracking**: Todo lists and milestone documentation

### Quality Assurance
- **Document Standards**: Template compliance and completeness
- **Relationship Integrity**: Valid cross-references and traceability
- **Data Consistency**: Synchronized indices and matrices

### Maintenance Operations
- **Regular Updates**: Index refreshes and relationship validation
- **Archive Management**: Completed work preservation
- **System Evolution**: Process improvement and automation enhancement

## Usage Guidelines

### For Human Operators
- **Standard Procedures**: Follow documented processes for consistency
- **Template Usage**: Always use provided templates for new documents
- **Quality Checks**: Validate work using provided checklists

### For LLM Agents
- **Task Templates**: Structured prompts for reliable automation
- **Output Validation**: Built-in checks for generated content
- **Process Documentation**: Clear instructions for complex operations

### For System Integration
- **API Standards**: Consistent data formats for tool integration
- **Export Formats**: Standard outputs for external systems
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and performance metrics
