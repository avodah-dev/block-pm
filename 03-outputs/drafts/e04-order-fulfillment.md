# E04-ORDER-FULFILLMENT: Order Processing and Shipment Tracking

## Epic Overview
**Size**: Large (12 stories, 3 features)
**Priority**: MVP - Core Functionality
**Primary Personas**: P02-Vendor (fulfillment side), P01-Buyer (tracking side)
**Requirements Coverage**: SWP-M-39, SWP-M-43, SWP-M-44, SWP-M-45, SWP-S-4, SW-M-31, SW-M-32, SW-M-33, SW-M-34, SW-M-35, SW-S-5

This epic manages the critical post-purchase workflow from the moment a purchase order is submitted through final delivery confirmation. It bridges the gap between buyers waiting for their parts and vendors managing fulfillment operations, ensuring both sides have visibility and control throughout the shipping process. The epic addresses Block's specific requirement that vendors must be able to enter tracking numbers, serial numbers, and RMA numbers individually with save capabilities, while automatically notifying buyers when these critical details are updated.

The fulfillment workflow solves Block's current pain point where order status visibility is limited and tracking information often gets lost in email chains. By moving orders from "Pending Fulfillments" to "Order History" when shipped, and providing comprehensive tracking with serial number capture, this epic ensures complete traceability for both warranty claims and asset management. The ability to handle partial fulfillments and cancellations addresses real-world scenarios where vendors can't always ship complete orders immediately.

## Feature F10: Order Confirmation Management

### Feature Summary
This feature establishes the vendor's order acknowledgment workflow, ensuring purchase orders are properly confirmed and fulfillment expectations are set. It provides vendors with the same view of the order that buyers see, maintaining transparency and reducing miscommunication about what was actually ordered. The confirmation process includes setting realistic shipping timelines, handling order modifications or cancellations, and managing partial fulfillment scenarios when vendors can only ship part of an order immediately.

The feature specifically addresses Block's requirement for vendors to have a "Confirm Order" button that triggers the fulfillment process, moving orders from the request queue into active fulfillment status. It also handles the complex scenario of order cancellations, which must update the PO status to 'Cancelled', notify the vendor via email, and move the record to Order History with a visual indicator showing cancellation status and reason - critical for maintaining clean order records and vendor relationships.

### User Stories

#### S037: Create order acknowledgment interface for vendors
As a vendor, I want to review and acknowledge incoming purchase orders with all details visible (PO number, materials, quantities, shipping address, special instructions) so that I can confirm I understand exactly what the buyer needs before committing to fulfillment.

#### S038: Implement confirmation with shipping timeline
As a vendor, I want to provide an estimated shipping date when confirming an order and communicate any constraints or delays upfront so that buyers can plan accordingly. The system should allow me to update this timeline if circumstances change.

#### S039: Build order cancellation capability for vendors
As a vendor, I want the ability to cancel an order before shipping if I discover I cannot fulfill it (stock issues, compatibility problems) so that the buyer can quickly source from another vendor. As a buyer, I want to cancel orders up until the vendor marks them as shipped, with automatic notification to the vendor including the cancellation reason.

#### S040: Design partial fulfillment handling
As a vendor, I want to indicate when I can only partially fulfill an order (shipping 3 of 5 requested units) and provide separate timelines for the remaining items so that buyers can decide whether to wait or source the remainder elsewhere. The system should track both the shipped and pending portions separately.

## Feature F11: Shipping Information Capture

### Feature Summary
This feature provides the comprehensive shipping data capture interface that vendors need to communicate fulfillment details to buyers. It implements Block's specific requirement that vendors must be able to enter tracking numbers, serial numbers, and RMA numbers with individual save capabilities - critical since this information often becomes available at different times during the fulfillment process. The feature ensures all shipping-critical information is captured systematically rather than lost in email threads or chat messages.

The shipping form addresses both standard fulfillment scenarios and Block's unique requirements like manual shipping forms for vendors who don't use standard carriers. It validates tracking numbers against carrier formats, maintains a history of serial numbers for warranty tracking, and ensures RMA numbers are properly recorded for return processing. When any shipping information is submitted, the system automatically notifies the buyer with the updates, fulfilling the requirement that customers get email notifications with tracking details.

### User Stories

#### S041: Implement shipping details collection form
As a vendor, I want a comprehensive form to enter all shipping information including carrier selection, tracking number, ship date, and estimated delivery so that buyers have complete visibility into their order status. The form should accommodate both standard carriers (UPS, FedEx) and custom shipping methods.

#### S042: Create tracking number entry and validation
As a vendor, I want to enter tracking numbers that are validated against carrier formats and automatically linked to carrier tracking pages so that buyers can easily track their shipments. The system should save tracking numbers individually as I receive them from shipping and automatically notify buyers when tracking is added.

#### S043: Build estimated delivery date management
As a vendor, I want to provide and update estimated delivery dates based on carrier information or my own logistics knowledge so that buyers can coordinate receipt of parts. The system should alert buyers if delivery dates change significantly from the original estimate.

#### S044: Design shipping document upload capability
As a vendor, I want to upload shipping documents like packing lists, customs forms, or shipping manifests so that buyers have all necessary documentation for receiving and processing. The system should support common document formats (PDF, images) with appropriate file size limits.

## Feature F12: Order Status Tracking

### Feature Summary
This feature creates the buyer-side order tracking experience, providing real-time visibility into fulfillment status from purchase through delivery. It implements Block's requirement for Order History views with specific columns including PO#, Vendor, Description, Quantity, Net Unit Amount, Serial Numbers, Tracking Numbers, RMA#, and Purchase Date. The dashboard aggregates order information from multiple vendors into a single view, eliminating the need for buyers to check multiple systems or email threads to understand order status.

The feature automatically moves orders from "Pending Fulfillments" to "Order History" when vendors mark them as shipped, maintaining clear separation between active and completed orders. It provides deep drill-down capabilities where buyers can click into any PO record to view the complete history including the original sourcing record (SRC), all EMA communications, and post-shipment details like tracking and serial numbers. This comprehensive view supports both operational needs (knowing when parts will arrive) and compliance requirements (maintaining complete procurement records).

### User Stories

#### S045: Create order status dashboard for buyers
As a buyer, I want a comprehensive dashboard showing all my pending and shipped orders with real-time status updates so that I can track what's coming when and plan accordingly. The dashboard should clearly separate pending fulfillments from shipped orders and provide visual indicators for orders requiring attention.

#### S046: Implement real-time status updates from vendors
As a buyer, I want to receive automatic updates when vendors change order status (confirmed, preparing, shipped, delivered) so that I'm always aware of my order progress without having to ask. These updates should appear in my dashboard and trigger email notifications for critical status changes.

#### S047: Build shipment tracking integration
As a buyer, I want tracking information automatically linked to carrier websites with real-time status updates pulled into the platform so that I can see delivery progress without leaving Sourcing Window. The integration should handle multiple carriers and display estimated delivery times based on tracking data.

#### S048: Design delivery confirmation workflow
As a buyer, I want to confirm receipt of orders and flag any issues with delivered items (missing parts, wrong items, damage) so that there's a clear record of successful deliveries versus problems requiring resolution. Vendors should be notified when orders are confirmed as received or when issues are reported.
