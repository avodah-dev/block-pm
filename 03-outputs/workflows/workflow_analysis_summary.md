## Requirements Coverage
- **Total Requirements**: 118 (61 buyer, 57 vendor)
- **Covered by Workflows**: 99 requirements (84%)
- **Gaps**: Primarily in reporting, analytics, admin functions

## Architectural Considerations

### Product Layer (Sourcing Window)
- Core marketplace functionality
- Vendor/buyer interactions
- Messaging and notifications
- Basic workflow orchestration

### Business Logic Layer
- Client-specific rules and markup
- System integration and sync
- Custom approval workflows
- Performance analytics

### Business System (Salesforce)
- Accounting and invoicing
- Customer relationships
- Inventory management
- Business reporting

## Workflow Relationships

### Linear Flows
- W01 → W03 → W02 → W05 (standard procurement)
- W08 → W09 (integrated vendor sourcing to fulfillment)

### Branching Patterns
- W06/W07 → W08 (different entry points to auto-sourcing)
- W02 → W05 OR W09 (standard vs. integrated fulfillment)

### Cross-Cutting
- W04 (messaging) available in all workflows
- Integrated vendor can participate in any workflow

## Critical Business Rules

### Integrated Vendor Rules
1. Can only source from vendors not in original request
2. Must maintain price transparency (except markup)
3. Own risk for third-party fulfillment
4. Cannot reveal brokering to end parties

### Auto-Sourcing Rules
1. Tiered release with configurable delays
2. Exclude original request vendors
3. Stop when sufficient quotes received
4. Maintain vendor performance metrics

### System Integration Rules
1. Salesforce remains system of record
2. Sourcing Window handles marketplace operations
3. Business Logic Layer bridges systems
4. No direct database access between systems

## Success Metrics to Track
- Request-to-quote time
- Quote-to-purchase conversion
- Fulfillment success rate
- Network utilization
- Markup optimization
- System synchronization accuracy
- User adoption rates

## Known Gaps Needing Features
- Admin workflows not documented
- Reporting capabilities minimal
- Vendor onboarding process
- Approval chains for high-value orders
- Bulk operations
- Historical analytics
- Performance dashboards

## Next Steps for Epic/Feature/Story Generation

### Suggested Epic Categories
1. **Core Marketplace Operations** (W01, W02, W03, W05)
2. **Communication & Collaboration** (W04 + enhancements)
3. **Integrated Vendor Capabilities** (W06, W07, W08, W09)
4. **System Integration & Sync** (BLL features)
5. **Analytics & Reporting** (gaps to fill)
6. **Administration & Configuration** (gaps to fill)

### Story Sizing Guidance
- Simple CRUD operations: 1-2 points
- Workflow steps: 2-3 points
- Integration points: 3-5 points
- Complex features (auto-sourcing): 5-8 points
- System-wide capabilities: 8-13 points

### Priority Considerations
1. **Phase1**: Core workflows (W01-W03, W05), basic integrated vendor (W06)
2. **Phase2**: Enhanced features, auto-sourcing (W08), full integration, analytics, reporting, admin
