## Overview
- **Persona**: P03-integrated-vendor
- **Goal**: Orchestrate fulfillment when selected for sourced parts
- **Trigger**: "I won, now I need to ship (but I don't have the part)"
- **Context**: Acting as broker between original buyer and third-party vendor

## Narrative Description

This workflow captures the delicate orchestration required when an integrated vendor wins a bid with inventory they don't actually possess. They've already done the hard work - sourced the part from their network, marked up the price, and won the buyer's business. Now comes the critical fulfillment dance where they must coordinate between two parties while maintaining a seamless experience for both.

The integrated vendor learns they've won through the usual channels - an email notification celebrating their selection, or by checking their dashboard's "Pending Fulfillment" section. But unlike a standard vendor who would simply pack and ship, the integrated vendor faces a unique challenge: they must now execute the purchase they previously only quoted.

The first critical step is confirming the order to the original buyer. This immediate confirmation serves multiple purposes - it acknowledges receipt, sets expectations, and buys time for the integrated vendor to orchestrate the actual fulfillment. The buyer sees this as normal vendor responsiveness, unaware of the complex choreography about to unfold behind the scenes.

Now the integrated vendor must pivot to their buyer role. They navigate to their sourcing requests (or receive a notification) and find the quote they previously selected and marked up. This is the moment of commitment - they must now actually purchase from the vendor they chose during the quoting process. They execute the buy, but with a crucial modification: the shipping address isn't their warehouse - it's the original buyer's location. This is drop-shipping at its most sophisticated.

The complexity here is in the information flow. The integrated vendor becomes an information broker as much as a parts broker:

**From the Original Buyer, they must capture:**
- Exact shipping address
- Any special delivery instructions
- Required delivery dates
- Contact information for delivery

**To the Third-Party Vendor, they must provide:**
- The purchase order
- The original buyer's shipping address (not their own)
- Any special shipping requirements
- Clear instructions that this is a drop-ship order

**From the Third-Party Vendor, they must receive:**
- Order confirmation
- Tracking numbers
- Serial numbers
- RMA numbers
- Estimated delivery dates
- Any shipping documentation

**To the Original Buyer, they must forward:**
- Confirmation that the order is being processed
- All tracking information
- Serial and RMA numbers
- Delivery updates
- Any issues or delays

The integrated vendor exists in a state of vigilant waiting. They've confirmed to the buyer, purchased from the vendor, and now must monitor both sides of the transaction. When the third-party vendor provides tracking information, the integrated vendor immediately forwards it to the buyer. When shipping updates occur, they pass through. If issues arise, they must manage them without revealing the true source.

This pass-through role requires sophisticated system support. The software needs to:
- Automatically link the buyer's order to the vendor purchase
- Forward tracking updates seamlessly
- Maintain audit trails for both transactions
- Alert the integrated vendor to any discrepancies
- Provide visibility into both sides of the transaction

The beauty of this system is its transparency to the end parties. The original buyer experiences what appears to be direct fulfillment from their chosen vendor. The third-party vendor ships to what appears to be the integrated vendor's customer. Only the integrated vendor sees the full picture, managing the relationship and taking responsibility for the entire transaction.

Risk management is crucial here. If the third-party vendor fails to deliver, can't fulfill, or ships incorrectly, the integrated vendor owns the problem. They're not just passing through information - they're taking full responsibility for the transaction's success. This is why the markup isn't just profit - it's risk compensation.

The workflow completes when the part successfully reaches the original buyer. The integrated vendor has successfully played their role as invisible orchestrator, having connected supply with demand while maintaining clean interfaces for both parties. The system should recognize this completion, close both transactions, and maintain the relationship data for future sourcing opportunities.
