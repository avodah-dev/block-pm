# W07: Integrated Vendor - Non-SW Buyer Timeline

## Input Sources
- **Image**: Non-SW Buyer Timeline diagram
- **Voice Narration**: Team discussion on phone/email order handling
- **Created Date**: 2025-09-25

## Overview
- **Persona**: P03-integrated-vendor
- **Goal**: Fulfill phone/email orders through SW network when lacking inventory
- **Trigger**: Phone call or email request from non-SW buyer
- **Context**: Business system (Salesforce) to Sourcing Window integration

## Narrative Description

This workflow captures a critical reality of the integrated vendor's world: not all buyers use Sourcing Window. Many orders still come in the old-fashioned way - a phone call from a long-time customer, an urgent email from a hospital needing a part immediately. The integrated vendor must bridge two worlds: their traditional business operations in Salesforce and the modern marketplace capabilities of Sourcing Window.

The journey begins when a buyer (let's say Detroit Medical) calls the integrated vendor directly. This isn't a Sourcing Window request - it's a traditional phone order. The integrated vendor's sales rep takes the call, enters the details into Salesforce (their system of record for accounting and order management), and the system automatically checks inventory.

Here's the inflection point: if they have stock, this stays entirely in their traditional flow - Salesforce handles everything, the part ships from their warehouse, and Sourcing Window never knows this transaction happened. But when they don't have stock, that's when the integration magic needs to happen.

The discussion between the team members revealed a fundamental tension here. There's a desire for automation - Salesforce firing off an event to Sourcing Window saying "I need this part" - but there's also the reality of human behavior and system boundaries. The pragmatic approach that emerged: when the integrated vendor doesn't have stock, they manually open Sourcing Window and create a buyer request for that part.

This is a crucial behavioral shift. Instead of making phone calls to their vendor network (the old way), they're now using Sourcing Window as their sourcing tool. They enter the part request in Sourcing Window, which then broadcasts it to their entire vendor network - all the vendors they're connected to as a buyer.

The vendors respond with quotes through Sourcing Window (following the standard W03 vendor quote workflow). The integrated vendor reviews these quotes in Sourcing Window, selects the best option, applies their markup, and then - here's where the systems converge again - they enter that marked-up price back into their Salesforce quote for the original customer.

An important operational detail emerged in the discussion: the challenge of team coordination. If you have a team of 10 people, how do you know who's working on what? The current state involves email notifications going to a shared inbox, with team members needing to coordinate ("Is Andy handling this one?"). This highlights a gap between the single-user mental model of Sourcing Window and the team-based reality of many vendor operations.

The workflow continues with the integrated vendor purchasing through Sourcing Window, then managing the drop-ship process. But there's a critical difference from W06: the shipping destination. Since this is their direct customer (not a Sourcing Window buyer), they need to ensure the third-party vendor ships to THEIR customer's address, not to them.

The architectural discussion revealed deeper questions about system boundaries. Should everything flow through Sourcing Window? Should there be automated synchronization between Salesforce and Sourcing Window? The answer isn't just technical - it's about business process and change management. As one team member noted, these vendors are used to seeing everything in "one view" in Salesforce. Asking them to monitor two systems is a behavioral change.

The consensus that emerged: Sourcing Window is a "power tool" for accessing the vendor network. Salesforce remains the system of record for the business. A business logic layer can bridge between them, handling callbacks, status updates, and data synchronization. But fundamentally, if you want to access the network of vendors, you use Sourcing Window. If you're managing your business operations, you use Salesforce.
