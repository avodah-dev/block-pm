## Narrative Description

This workflow represents the sophisticated decision-making and sourcing capabilities that make integrated vendors so powerful in the Sourcing Window ecosystem. When an integrated vendor receives a request to submit pricing, they face a critical decision point that determines their entire response strategy.

The journey begins simply enough - a request arrives asking for pricing on a part. If the integrated vendor has stock, they follow the standard vendor workflow: enter their pricing, specify conditions, warranty terms, and submit. Business as usual. But it's when they DON'T have stock that the real power of being an integrated vendor reveals itself.

Instead of simply marking "no stock" and losing the opportunity, the integrated vendor can transform into a buyer and create a request for that exact part from their network of connected vendors. But here's the crucial constraint: they can only request from vendors who aren't already part of the original buyer's request. This prevents duplicate quotes and maintains clean competitive boundaries.

The integrated vendor now faces a choice: manually select vendors or use the powerful "auto-sourcing" feature. Auto-sourcing is what we might call a "premium user feature" or "power tool" - it's the difference between calling ten vendors individually and having an intelligent system orchestrate your entire sourcing strategy.

Here's how auto-sourcing works: An integrated vendor might be connected to 50+ vendors, but they know from experience that not all vendors are created equal. They have their top tier - maybe 10 vendors who consistently deliver quality parts quickly. Then they have their second tier - another 10 who are reliable but maybe slower or more expensive. And then a third tier for specialized or backup suppliers.

The tiered release system is elegant in its simplicity but powerful in its effect. When the integrated vendor triggers auto-sourcing, the system first releases the request ONLY to Tier 1 vendors. These preferred vendors get first shot at the business. After a configured time period (maybe 10 minutes, maybe an hour - this would be configurable), if sufficient quotes haven't been received, the system automatically releases to Tier 2 vendors. And if needed, after another delay, to Tier 3.

This tiered approach serves multiple purposes:
- It rewards vendor relationships and performance
- It prevents overwhelming the integrated vendor with too many quotes at once
- It allows for quick responses from preferred vendors before opening to broader market
- It maintains competitive dynamics while managing complexity

The architectural question here is interesting: Where does the tier configuration live? In the discussion, several options emerged:
- Could be in the business system (Salesforce) with an API providing tier lists
- Could be in the business logic layer for client-specific tiering rules
- Could be a Product feature with configurable tiers per integrated vendor

Regardless of where the configuration lives, the Product must support the tiered release mechanism - this is core functionality that enables sophisticated sourcing strategies.

As quotes come in from the tiered vendors (following the standard vendor quote submission process), the integrated vendor reviews them. They might receive 4 quotes from 2 tiers of vendors. They evaluate based on price, warranty, condition, and their knowledge of vendor reliability. They might select one option, or strategically, they might select two options to give their buyer choice.

Here's where the markup feature becomes critical. The integrated vendor takes the selected quote(s) and marks up the pricing. This isn't just adding a random percentage - it's their value-add for:
- Orchestrating the sourcing process
- Taking responsibility for the transaction
- Managing vendor relationships
- Handling any issues that arise
- Providing a single point of contact

The markup feature could be simple (user manually adjusts price) or sophisticated (automatic percentage markup, tiered markup based on value, dynamic markup based on competition). For now, we'll treat it as a feature that allows price adjustment with potential for enhancement.

The integrated vendor then submits their marked-up quote to the original buyer. Importantly, they pass through all the original warranty terms and conditions - they're transparent about everything except the price markup. The buyer sees what appears to be a standard vendor quote, unaware of the complex sourcing that happened behind the scenes.

If the buyer selects the integrated vendor's quote and purchases, only the integrated vendor gets notified initially. They then must cascade that purchase down to their selected vendor, initiating the fulfillment process. This creates a clean communication chain: buyer ‚Üí integrated vendor ‚Üí selected vendor.

The beauty of this system is its recursive nature. In theory, the selected vendor could themselves be an integrated vendor, creating multi-tier sourcing chains. The system handles this elegantly through the parent/child requisition ID structure.
