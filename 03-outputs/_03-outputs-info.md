# 03-Outputs Directory

## Purpose
This directory contains all deliverable outputs from the requirements analysis process. These are the structured, actionable documents that guide development work and stakeholder communication.

## Directory Structure
```
03-outputs/
├── drafts/                # Draft analysis and generated development structures
├── epics/                 # Finalized epic-level development containers
├── features/              # Finalized feature specifications
├── personas/              # User type definitions and characteristics
├── stories/               # Finalized user stories for development
└── workflows/             # Complete user journey documentation
```

## Subdirectories

### personas/
User type definitions that inform all development decisions.
- **Current**: 3 personas (Buyer, Vendor, Integrated Vendor)
- **Format**: JSON with structured behavioral and needs data
- **Usage**: Referenced by all workflows, features, and stories

### workflows/
Complete user journeys that span multiple system features.
- **Current**: 9 documented workflows covering core platform capabilities
- **Structure**: Step-by-step user actions with system responses
- **Relationships**: Each workflow serves primary persona, uses multiple features

### drafts/
Work-in-progress analysis and generated development structures.
- **Purpose**: Safe space for LLM-generated content before human review
- **Contents**: Epic/Feature/Story analysis, requirements mapping drafts
- **Status**: Contains completed draft analysis ready for finalization

### epics/
Large development containers representing major value delivery.
- **Scope**: Multiple features that deliver cohesive business value
- **Traceability**: Each epic traces to client requirements and personas
- **Timeline**: Typically span multiple sprints/releases

### features/
Functional capabilities that enable specific user actions.
- **Granularity**: Implementable capabilities that fit within sprints
- **Cross-cutting**: Features appear in multiple workflows
- **Testing**: Each feature has defined acceptance criteria

### stories/
Smallest implementable units of user value.
- **Format**: "As a [persona], I want [capability] so that [value]"
- **Sizing**: Designed to fit within single sprint iterations
- **Traceability**: Links back through feature → epic → requirements

## Development Hierarchy
```
Requirements (from 01-sources)
    ↓
Epics (major value themes)
    ↓
Features (functional capabilities)
    ↓
Stories (implementable units)
```

## Cross-Reference Model
- **Personas** → use → **Workflows** → enable → **Features** → contain → **Stories**
- **Stories** → build → **Features** → compose → **Epics** → fulfill → **Requirements**

## Current Status

### Completed
- **Personas**: 3 core user types defined
- **Workflows**: 9 complete user journeys documented
- **Draft Analysis**: Full epic/feature/story breakdown generated

### In Progress
- **Epic Finalization**: Moving draft epics to final specification
- **Feature Documentation**: Detailed feature requirements and acceptance criteria
- **Story Refinement**: Converting draft stories to development-ready format

### Planned
- **Additional Workflows**: 7-10 more workflows expected from discovery analysis
- **Story Estimation**: Development effort sizing for sprint planning
- **Acceptance Testing**: Test case generation from acceptance criteria

## Quality Standards

### All Outputs Must Have
- **Traceability**: Clear links back to source requirements
- **Persona Connection**: Explicit user type served
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Testable success conditions
- **Business Value**: Clear explanation of why this matters

### Formatting Standards
- **IDs**: Consistent prefixing (P01-, W01-, E01-, F01-, S01-)
- **Templates**: Standardized structure for easy consumption
- **Cross-References**: Explicit links between related documents

## Maintenance Process
1. **Draft → Review → Finalize** for all development items
2. **Update** when requirements change or discovery reveals new needs
3. **Archive** completed items with implementation notes
4. **Validate** traceability integrity during major updates

## Key Relationships
- **Sources**: Analysis in `/02-analysis/` validates completeness
- **Architecture**: Feasibility confirmed in `/04-operations/architecture/`
- **Process**: Development methodology in `/04-operations/processes/`

## Usage Patterns
- **Sprint Planning**: Query stories by epic or feature for backlog creation
- **Stakeholder Review**: Present workflows and epics for business validation
- **Development Handoff**: Provide complete story specifications to engineering
- **Testing**: Use acceptance criteria for test case generation
