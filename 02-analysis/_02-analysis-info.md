# 02-Analysis Directory

## Purpose
This directory contains all analytical work that processes and interprets the source materials from `/01-sources/`. It bridges the gap between raw requirements and development planning by providing traceability, coverage analysis, and insight extraction.

## Directory Structure
```
02-analysis/
├── insights/              # Discovery insights and requirement interpretations
├── mappings/              # Relationship mappings between system elements
└── requirements/          # Requirements traceability and coverage analysis
```

## Subdirectories

### requirements/
Core requirements analysis and traceability management.
- **Coverage Analysis**: Tracks which client requirements are addressed in RFP responses
- **Gap Analysis**: Identifies unaddressed, partial, or over-delivered requirements
- **Traceability Matrix**: Maps client requirements to responses to implementation plans
- **Status**: 43.2% initial coverage identified, gaps documented for planning

### mappings/
Relationship tracking between different system elements.
- **Workflow-Requirements**: Maps user workflows to specific requirements they fulfill
- **Cross-References**: Links between personas, workflows, and features
- **Dependencies**: Tracks how different system components relate to each other

### insights/
Processed intelligence from discovery sessions and requirement analysis.
- **Discovery Analysis**: Key findings from stakeholder interviews
- **Requirement Interpretations**: What requirements actually mean in practice
- **Business Context**: Strategic context that affects technical decisions

## Key Analytical Products

### Requirements Matrix (`requirements/requirements-matrix.json`)
Master tracking document that shows:
- All client requirements with unique IDs
- Coverage status (addressed/partial/not-addressed/deferred)
- Links to RFP responses and planned implementation
- Priority and complexity assessments

### Traceability Matrix (`requirements/requirements-traceability-matrix.json`)
Comprehensive mapping showing:
- Client requirement → RFP response → Implementation plan
- Full audit trail from source request to delivery
- Variance tracking (where implementation differs from original)

### Gap Analysis (`requirements/gap-analysis.md`)
Executive summary showing:
- Unaddressed requirements and their business impact
- Areas where we're over-delivering beyond client requests
- Recommendations for requirement prioritization

## Data Sources
- **Input from**: `/01-sources/` (client requirements, RFP responses, transcripts)
- **Feeds into**: `/03-outputs/` (personas, workflows, development planning)
- **References**: `/04-operations/architecture/` for technical feasibility

## Analysis Workflow
1. **Extract** requirements from source documents
2. **Map** RFP responses to client requirements
3. **Identify** gaps, overlaps, and variations
4. **Trace** requirements through to planned implementation
5. **Report** coverage status and recommendations

## Maintenance Requirements
- Update matrices when new requirements are discovered
- Refresh gap analysis after major planning sessions
- Maintain traceability as development plans evolve
- Archive completed analysis to preserve decision rationale

## Key Metrics Tracked
- **Total Requirements**: 118 (61 buyer-focused, 57 vendor-focused)
- **Coverage Percentage**: Currently 43.2% from initial RFP response
- **Priority Distribution**: High/Medium/Low priority breakdown
- **Implementation Status**: Planned/In Progress/Complete/Deferred

## Access Patterns
- **Research Mode**: Query specific requirements, check coverage status
- **Planning Mode**: Review gap analysis for sprint planning
- **Reporting Mode**: Generate status reports for stakeholders
- **Validation Mode**: Verify implementation completeness

## Critical Files
- `requirements/requirements-matrix.json` - Master requirements tracking
- `requirements/gap-analysis.md` - Current coverage status
- `mappings/workflow-steps-requirements-matrix.json` - Feature-requirement links
