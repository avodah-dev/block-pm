# Requirements Analysis Folder Documentation

## Purpose
This folder contains the core analytical work that bridges source requirements with development planning. It tracks coverage, identifies gaps, and maintains traceability between client requirements, our RFP responses, and planned implementation within the structured project hierarchy.

## Core Files

### analysis_methodology.md
- **Purpose**: Documents the actual process used to generate epics/features/stories
- **Contents**: Six-phase methodology from requirements to validation
- **Created**: September 2025 to capture successful analysis approach
- **Usage**: Reference for repeating or improving the analysis process

### gap-analysis.md
- **Purpose**: Executive summary of requirements coverage
- **Current Status**: 100% coverage achieved in draft epics/features/stories
- **Contents**: Coverage breakdown, implementation distribution, risk analysis
- **Last Updated**: September 2025 (post-discovery analysis)
- **Update Frequency**: After major requirement reviews or implementation changes

### requirements-matrix.json
- **Purpose**: Machine-readable requirement tracking for tooling integration
- **Current State**: Empty placeholder - awaiting draft approval
- **Will Contain**: All 118 requirements with epic/feature/story mappings
- **Build Trigger**: After Block approves draft and before sprint planning
- **Future Usage**: Sprint planning tools, JIRA/Linear import, automated reporting

### requirements-traceability-matrix.json
- **Purpose**: Detailed requirement-to-implementation mapping
- **Current State**: Contains pre-discovery analysis (43.2% coverage) - outdated
- **Will Contain**: Updated mapping showing 100% coverage with story IDs
- **Build Trigger**: When moving from draft to implementation phase
- **Future Usage**: Progress tracking, test coverage, compliance reporting

## Relationships to Other Folders

### Inputs From
- `/01-sources/client-requirements/`: Source requirements (CAD-001, CAD-002)
- `/01-sources/rfp-responses/`: Response commitments (RRD-001, RRD-002)
- `/01-sources/transcripts/`: Discovery insights and requirement clarifications
- `/03-outputs/drafts/`: Implementation planning and coverage analysis

### Outputs To
- `/03-outputs/epics/`, `/03-outputs/features/`, `/03-outputs/stories/`: Gap identification drives development priorities
- `/03-outputs/workflows/`: Requirements inform workflow design
- `/04-operations/processes/`: Analysis methodology for repeatable processes
- Root documentation files for stakeholder reporting

## Usage Patterns

### For Gap Analysis
1. Compare requirements-traceability-matrix.json against current implementation
2. Generate gap-analysis.md report
3. Identify high-priority unaddressed requirements
4. Update development backlog accordingly

### For Traceability Verification
1. Start with a requirement ID from requirements-traceability-matrix.json
2. Trace to RFP response in `/01-sources/rfp-responses/`
3. Follow to implementation in `/03-outputs/epics/`, `/03-outputs/features/`, `/03-outputs/stories/`
4. Verify workflow coverage in `/03-outputs/workflows/`

## Maintenance Notes

### During Draft Phase (Current)
- Keep gap-analysis.md current with draft changes
- Document methodology improvements
- Track stakeholder feedback

### Post-Approval Phase
- Build JSON files from approved drafts
- Establish automated update processes
- Create tooling integration scripts

### During Implementation
- Update JSON files as stories complete
- Track requirement satisfaction
- Monitor coverage metrics
- Generate compliance reports

## Key Metrics (Current Draft Analysis)
- Total Requirements: 118 (61 buyer, 57 vendor)
- Coverage in Draft: 118 (100%)
- Deferred to Future: 3 (2.5%) - low priority items
- Categories: Must Have (89), Should Have (14), Could Have (15)

## JSON File Generation Timeline

### Phase 1: Current State (Pre-Approval)
- Human-readable documents (MD files) for review
- Draft analysis in `/03-outputs/drafts/`
- Gap analysis showing 100% coverage

### Phase 2: Post-Approval (Build JSON Files)
**Trigger**: Block approves draft epics/features/stories
**Actions**:
1. Generate `requirements-matrix.json` from approved epics/features
2. Update `requirements-traceability-matrix.json` with story mappings
3. Create integration files for project management tools

### Phase 3: Implementation Tracking
**Usage**: JSON files enable:
- Automated sprint planning
- Linear/JIRA integration
- Progress dashboards
- Test coverage tracking
- Compliance reporting
