SWP-M-13,Phase 1,,Ability for user to create a Requisition with multiple requests (Req items) on it, Req can have anywhere from 1-multiple items,No,"Can we treat like amazon? Multiple parts, different vendors
Past orders show individual parts not orders
This allows a buyer to start a req with 5 parts but be able to checkout with just 4 parts when ready, or 2 parts from one vendor annd 3 parts from another

This is just a way to track a group of reqs",req can have multiple part requests on them,,,,,,,,,,,
SWP-M-14,Phase 1,,Ability for Buyer to Add a Customer Reference Number,"Doing so can help them identify which Reqs are related to a specific deal.

SWP-M-20,Phase 1,Req Item View,Buyer must be able to click into Req and see all requested Req Items,"This let's them see 1+ parts on the order, with ability to drill down further to see purchasing options",No,"I would argue - a req with mult parts is just a fast way to multi req but post that initial they become individual. They can be grouped for checking out (like add to cart) but otherwise seperate. So that a missing item on the order doesnt hold up the process. Or you can checkout with different vendors, if you want 2 items from one vendor and 1 from the other - based on quotes",,,,,,,,,,,,
SWP-M-21,Phase 1,,"Under req item, Buyer must view all SRC options in one view to do a 'quick select' of their preferred choice","SRC's live under Req Items, Req items live under Req.

SWP-S-1,Phase 2?,,Ability for a Customer to Indicate what was purchased but process order outside of portal,"Currently customer has to add SRC to cart and check up, requiring them to upload a PO and submit. Many large hospitals have completely separate teams or automated systems that will generate the PO and send them. We need a solution to allow for us to still track purchasing information, but not require the sending of the PO through the portal",Yes,We could have a specific inbox that could try to automate this? Require the PO to reference something or supplier of some kind,,,,,,,,,,,,
SWP-S-2,Phase 1 - Discuss,,FAQ tab on SWP Homepage ,"A place where buyers can access training videos, tips and tricks, release updates, etc",Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We should record and communicate WHY the order was cancelled ",Yes,"I would assume you can cancel up until the vendor marks the order ""shipped"" or something",,,,,,,,,,,,
SWP-S-5,Phase 1,,"If Order was cancelled, the customer should get a Pop up asking if they want to close out the Requisition as Not Needed or to purchase a different SRC (ie: They can add another option to the cart and check out again, as the record was re-opened once they cancelled their first PO)",,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,
