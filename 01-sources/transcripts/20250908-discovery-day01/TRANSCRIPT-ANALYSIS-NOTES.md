# Discovery Day 1 Transcript Analysis Notes

## Analysis Date
2025-09-26

## Transcripts Reviewed
- **File**: `09-08 - 3 - Discovery Day 1, External Buyers & Sellers, Part 1.srt`
- **Full transcript review**: Lines 1-1157 (complete file)
- **Key sections analyzed**:
  - Lines 831-859: FSE persona discussion
  - Lines 1070-1142: Internal buyer system complexity
  - Lines 1143-1157: User mental models for workflows

## Purpose of Analysis
Test whether discovery transcript details would:
1. Change requirement-workflow-story connections in the traceability matrix
2. Add implementation details to existing stories
3. Reveal gaps in original requirements

## Key Findings

### 1. Implementation Details That Enhance Stories
**FSE-specific pain points**:
- FSE is confirmed as distinct persona from procurement buyer
- Needs "completely different profile type"
- **Impact**: Validates stories S141-S144 (mobile FSE support) and S068 (multiple profiles)

**Internal buyer system integration**:
- Internal buyers work exclusively in Salesforce 360
- Must not know they're using Sourcing Window underneath
- Web interface provides transparent access to sourcing logic
- **Impact**: Strengthens S117-S120 (Salesforce integration stories) with "seamless integration" requirement

### 2. Discovery of Missing Requirements
**User mental models** (the "I need a part" workflow):
- Three distinct states users navigate between:
  1. "I need a part" → Request creation
  2. "I have options here" → Quote review
  3. "I need to choose a vendor" → Selection/purchase
- **Gap identified**: No requirement for workflow state persistence/management

**Platform Admin persona**:
- Explicitly separate from buyer/vendor account management
- Distinct from internal/external management personas
- **Gap identified**: Platform admin role not in original requirements

### 3. Validation of Discovery-Driven Stories
**Auto-sourcing complexity**:
- "Everything's auto sourced" for internal buyers
- Tiered vendor management confirmed as core feature
- **Validation**: Stories S101-S104 (auto-sourcing engine) correctly identified from discovery

**System architecture boundaries**:
- Internal operations remain in Salesforce
- Sourcing logic moves to new platform
- Business packaged as standalone product
- **Validation**: 3-layer architecture and S113-S124 integration stories confirmed

## Impact Assessment

### Does NOT Change Requirement Mappings
- Discovery details are implementation specifics, not new functional requirements
- Workflows W01-W09 remain accurately documented
- Requirement-to-story mappings in traceability matrix remain valid

### WOULD Add Detail to Stories
- **S068**: Add FSE-specific profile configuration requirements
- **S117-S120**: Add "transparent integration" specification
- **S141**: Include "parts basket" workflow detail from FSE discussion
- **S125**: Define platform admin as distinct role with specific permissions

### Reveals Gaps in Original Requirements
1. **Workflow state management**: No requirement for persisting user progress across sessions
2. **Platform admin role**: Not specified in original 118 requirements
3. **Transparent integration**: No explicit requirement for hiding system boundaries from internal users

## Conclusion
The transcript analysis **validates** our requirement coverage is accurate. The discovery session provided:
- Implementation details that enrich story descriptions
- Confirmation that 26% of stories from discovery address real, undocumented needs
- Evidence that critical functionality was discussed but not captured in written requirements

## Next Steps for Full Transcript Analysis
When reviewing remaining transcripts, focus on:
1. Additional implementation details for existing stories
2. Further validation of discovery-driven stories
3. Identification of requirements discussed but not documented
4. Technical constraints and architectural decisions
5. User pain points that inform story acceptance criteria
