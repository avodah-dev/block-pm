1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:30,060
Speaker 1: Oh, Sam still has to put her stuff up. Oh, yeah. We ought to know you're tenacious. Everybody in your team here is just about tenacious. What is it? What was it? What was it, Josh? Did you guys try to do it? They don't think anybody did proper work. Oh, wow. It was just a pattern practice. Yeah. Because we needed to get things done. I remember Josh asking us, like, are you tenacious when he's talking about the concept. And I was like, yeah.

2
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:48,660
Speaker 1: But I was like, I might have realized I was saying, yeah, I'm intense. And he was not, by definition, tenacious. To get to know you better. Oh. Maybe I need to take a look. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You have to share with us either an aha moment or anything related to categorizing you so we know everything about you, by the way. Okay.

3
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,810
Speaker 2: If they don't trickle over your room. Dang that. Great.

4
00:00:52,980 --> 00:01:04,602
Speaker 3: Wait, how personality is great? Or, like, what in nature? I said in the beginning. Like, how does it mean anything to anyone that doesn't know me? They all know. Oh, you do? All right. Well, I'm in Enneagram 1, Wing 9.

5
00:01:04,902 --> 00:01:06,381
Speaker 1: Wait. Does that mean there's three of you here. 

6
00:01:06,562 --> 00:01:15,112
Speaker 4: So, me and Sam are almost identical people. We are so weird. Like, when I met Nikki... I was going to say that. We actually have a section. It was, like, uncomfortable.

7
00:01:15,352 --> 00:01:17,842
Speaker 3: It was, like, we are... We do a lot.

8
00:01:17,922 --> 00:01:19,622
Speaker 4: I mean, there's a lot going on, and it's the same.

9
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:53,222
Speaker 3: We're just, like, so similar. Can I say this? Yeah. So, TE, Static Enablement, Enneagram 1, Wing 9, which... God bless my nine. My aha moment, I think, was that, like, pit in my stomach I feel when I walk into a meeting and someone starts by saying, like, I'm going to daydream. This whole meeting, we're going to dream. And I'm, like, oh, kill me not. Yeah. Waste of time to dream and, like, not do anything. So, the aha moment was, like, oh, I'm just not wired to be a big dreamer.

10
00:01:54,192 --> 00:01:55,112
Speaker 3: So, that was it.

11
00:01:55,292 --> 00:02:32,293
Speaker 4: It gave me a lot of freedom to appreciate what I am good at. yeah and give it a name yeah like that for me was a big thing and where I fit in with a good team you know and knowing that if I miss out it's not all my fault because I'm not wired to be inventive I just hate whiteboards when I see one that I'm like just to start off from nothing it's like I can't grasp on I.

12
00:02:32,293 --> 00:02:42,914
Speaker 4: can't get high enough in my thoughts to see that yeah hundred thousand foot view yeah I have to latch on to something give me a cloud I mean anything.

13
00:02:42,914 --> 00:03:14,166
Speaker 1: in my house and two regular whiteboard whiteboards like one in my office and a black one in my office another one in another room one in my kitchen, yeah I'm gonna write down this or my kids have a question about, I'm going to do it on a whiteboard. My wife says, this is what kids would complain about. She's like, this is what we're talking about at dinner. I've got a strategy. I've discerned and invented a problem.

14
00:03:14,406 --> 00:03:35,166
Speaker 1: No, no, no. What? It's not very one-ish. Like, have you list? Like, I thought, OK, I do. No, no, no list. Oh, no list. Zero list. My wife uses the list, and I erase the list. Oh! Zero list. I want a clean board at all times. I wish somebody would just go behind me and erase it all so that I can come back and do it again. I have a new idea.

15
00:03:35,566 --> 00:03:37,866
Speaker 4: Is your middle name like Patrick Lencioni. 

16
00:03:39,256 --> 00:03:44,986
Speaker 1: I had never heard of him until Josh had mentioned when I was interviewing him.

17
00:03:45,286 --> 00:03:48,306
Speaker 4: So you hadn't read like the five discussions of the team. 

18
00:03:48,426 --> 00:04:19,339
Speaker 1: I haven't read any of them. Really? Until, like I said, I was interviewing Josh. And before I did the interviews with the rest of the team, well, the rest with the subset of the team, He had said that everybody first reads the leadership one. Leadership and subsection, I thought, I should probably read what you guys read. So I kind of had an idea of what it's like to be on board the block. And then I thought, oh, this is awesome. So I actually picked up two or three of these other things and read them, because I like the allegories.

19
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:48,000
Speaker 1: They're things I felt like I could share with non-corporate professional people and still connect with the ideas on it, so that was really fun. Cool. OK, thank you for participating. Sam. Really cool. That's all right. How many hours did I make it? One and a half. It's a new record. Yeah, you guys are friends.

20
00:04:50,200 --> 00:05:21,621
Speaker 1: So the rest of today is going to be about outlining these workflows with incredible precision. decision, and we want to start, we made some assumptions. We believe that there are five primary workflows that you guys. execute within these two systems. And we may or may not be right. So don't think, just, and these workflows, within them, there are tinier workflows, right?

21
00:05:21,741 --> 00:05:40,712
Speaker 1: So these are what I would call the big picture workflows. So before we actually show you what our five workflows are, we work through one, and the first one will probably be the slowest, and then we'll get to what we get. Nick, I guess I wanted to give us, take maybe, do you want to turn that clock to 15 minutes? I'm thinking of 15 minutes, I have no idea.

22
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:47,832
Steve Muniak: Oh, wait, sorry, can you interrupt me? Yeah, no, keep going. When we take a break later, we'll do it.

23
00:05:47,912 --> 00:06:13,273
Speaker 1: No, let's do two, three, four, and then I will. We'll probably get to something about two, so I don't mind. If you want to wait, I'm just saying. I got to pick up a good line. Oh, I'm not going to lie. That's his lie right there. You guys don't know. I did not try to, I was just trying to, I never liked it. No? No. Okay. Who wants to go first? Me? I'm not ready. I thought you were saying you had a great life. No, I don't think you have a good life.

24
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,073
Speaker 4: You're inventive. I mean, like, you can invent a lot.

25
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:48,013
Jake Herwaldt: I can actually go first. But I'm also a pastor, so I've learned each day. I wrote mine down, because I had to think about it. And I know if I'm like, what is my life? All right, so, all of them, we were talking about broken bones. I almost shared stories, and I was like, hold on. So, all of mine are around broken bones. So, I broke my arm falling out of a ride at Cedar Point, middle school. When I was 18 months old, I broke my leg, and my parents didn't realize it was broke for a couple days.

26
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:57,393
Jake Herwaldt: In high school, I broke my leg on a beach on Christmas Day. That's very deep. They're all pretty deep.

27
00:06:57,854 --> 00:07:03,295
Speaker 3: The middle one wasn't. Was it the same leg you broke when you were a baby. 

28
00:07:04,325 --> 00:07:12,725
Jake Herwaldt: Oh, that's a good question. It was to the left. Actually, it was the same leg. It was. But I broke my other leg, too, as well. I've broken a lot of bones.

29
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:13,805
Speaker 3: Really. 

30
00:07:13,985 --> 00:07:14,585
Jake Herwaldt: Yeah, actually.

31
00:07:14,785 --> 00:07:15,625
Speaker 3: More than just your leg. 

32
00:07:16,695 --> 00:07:28,895
Jake Herwaldt: My, yeah, my legs and my arms. Yeah. That surprised me. Well, that's a good one. I found out at night school I had a bone problem. But we're good now. We're good now. Makes sense.

33
00:07:30,355 --> 00:07:32,815
Speaker 1: Are we supposed to write the answers down? How does this work? I don't know.

34
00:07:33,275 --> 00:07:33,995
Jake Herwaldt: Somebody call me up.

35
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:48,835
Speaker 1: Somebody has to do a bold assertion. And if they're wrong, they have one in the plank. And if they're right, the other person has a... That's the way we do things. You did not break your arm into your form.

36
00:07:49,985 --> 00:07:51,085
Steve Muniak: That's my bold assertion.

37
00:07:51,085 --> 00:07:56,465
Speaker 4: I'm going to say the Christmas Day one. You're going to a beach on Christmas Day. 

38
00:07:59,126 --> 00:08:04,839
Speaker 1: I've done it. Oh yeah. You think he's got a truth there, but he adjusted it for the lie.

39
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:28,189
Jake Herwaldt: Yeah, that's wild. It's like 90% truth. Well, it wasn't on Christmas Day. I can just reveal. Am I really? I think Cedar Point went live. I am Cedar Point, probably.

40
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:34,989
Speaker 2: You were traveling to the beach somewhere. That had happened. How did your parents not know that you broke. 

41
00:08:35,250 --> 00:09:11,161
Jake Herwaldt: I was 18 months. They just thought I wasn't crawling. But I was walking at the time. I don't know. I kind of slid into it. Walking? It happened. I mean, I was walking. It happened to one of my kids, too. Wow. They were just like, we just thought you were tired for two days. How did you break it? Do you know? I was kicking a soccer ball down a hill. My brother was playing soccer. down a hill and apparently my dad doesn't know he was watching me he I was at the bottom of the hill. How many siblings and what was your name? I'm one of four, I'm the third.

42
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:17,521
Speaker 4: There you go, little children. We get forgotten about. Figure it out yourself.

43
00:09:18,132 --> 00:09:21,431
Speaker 1: Usually they say it takes like the first one's pretty good and then the 12th one's good.

44
00:09:26,201 --> 00:09:35,541
Steve Muniak: I'm number two in the list, I don't know what that means. I'll go next. I'm a German citizen, I cater on the side as a side hustle and I have a sports pilot license.

45
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:49,581
Speaker 1: Do you have a what? A sports pilot license. That sounds real to me because it's very specific and unfiltered, but it could be a weird one. I don't think you cater on the side. I mean if you did, I would be in touch.

46
00:09:49,742 --> 00:09:55,502
Speaker 2: I just said cater on the side. I just fed 50 people yesterday.

47
00:09:55,941 --> 00:10:27,284
Steve Muniak: Oh! I did all my kids' rehearsal dinners, all that. I am a German citizen, I have dual citizenship as of 2020, up until then German citizenship was passed down only on the paternal side, we made a decision to allow for maternal citizenships and my son led the charge, we all have, we're all German citizens, and I do not have a sports.

48
00:10:27,284 --> 00:10:44,493
Steve Muniak: license. What does that mean, by the way? What's that? What does that mean? Sports is a much lower license than a typical, but if you wanted to do ultralights and things like that, it's something I've thought about. I saw somebody cruising on that.

49
00:10:45,733 --> 00:11:14,186
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, the pair of poles. Right over our house the other day, I didn't think it was you. There was who can come at you. Yeah, there was Randy Peters. I've thought about it. Alright, I have my light. Hang on, I'm really not good at this one, you guys. I've been in two more political actions in my life. I have a pretty bad peanut allergy. And what's the lie? No.

50
00:11:19,426 --> 00:11:24,526
Speaker 1: I have a... If I could go to the moon in my life, I might would.

51
00:11:26,836 --> 00:11:34,416
Speaker 3: Okay, very good. I'll just go to the moon. I just need my wife to sign up on this and I do not have that. Yeah. I mean, I have a kidney to be a word then.

52
00:11:37,886 --> 00:11:46,866
Steve Muniak: Peanut allergy. Yeah, that's a good thing. Let me just find out right now. I also didn't really expect that.

53
00:11:48,606 --> 00:11:50,866
Speaker 1: No label. I don't look at it.

54
00:11:50,906 --> 00:11:57,966
Jake Herwaldt: I'm so glad I don't look at allergies right now. Fortunately, more political actions weren't like that, but they were unpleasant.

55
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,780
Speaker 3: And that was before you had kids. 

56
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:20,760
Speaker 1: That was before I had kids, yeah, yeah. Because that would have been, yeah, a lot of things would be... Oh, yeah. And that's right, we talked about Cedar Point, because you kind of knew that was a lot, because I did that for my first accident. Like, Cedar Point was a ton of fun, and then you have an accident, and all of a sudden it's a scary event. The idea that some of the changes in your body, you're like, we're doing it again. Get on with your ride.

57
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:26,370
Speaker 2: I have to think of stuff that, like, Sam and Vicki and...

58
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:56,340
Speaker 3: I know! Oh, I know! That's how I work with these guys. Yeah, that's true. Pretty wild. Okay, I have a dumb one. I've been skydiving, Rocky Mountain climbing, and I went 2.7 seconds on a bulldozer. I've never heard that before. That sounds like a great idea. Yeah! Which one of those is not true? Say that. I'm not guessing. No? I have a feeling I know.

59
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:04,292
Speaker 3: The song. Mm-hmm. I went skydiving, I went... Rocky Mountain Climbing, and I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu.

60
00:13:04,532 --> 00:13:08,072
Speaker 1: I mean, that's a very specific third one, so I would be really impressed if you did that.

61
00:13:08,592 --> 00:13:15,832
Speaker 3: Unless you named the bull after you did it. How do you get skydiving since you've lived on a picture of your ranch dream? It doesn't have a deuterium, so that helps.

62
00:13:15,832 --> 00:13:18,522
Speaker 7: Oh, that's good to know, because that does help. And you would name the bull.

63
00:13:21,462 --> 00:13:22,382
Speaker 4: That's so tricky, isn't it. 

64
00:13:23,792 --> 00:13:24,572
Steve Muniak: Is it a real bull. 

65
00:13:25,092 --> 00:13:28,402
Speaker 4: Yeah. It's impressive. She did live in Colorado.

66
00:13:28,702 --> 00:13:31,322
Steve Muniak: I know. So I really did live that first one. Skydiving.

67
00:13:33,402 --> 00:13:56,922
Speaker 3: I have been skydiving and Rocky Mountain Climbing, and I have heard a real bull. But it's not. But its name was not Fu Manchu. And it was way more than 2.7 seconds for me. I wrote it like a horror film. I was like, all right. I was like, why is it tough? I know. It's a very old text of all. It was not fucking. It's so funny. I'll freak out. Of course.

68
00:14:00,364 --> 00:14:08,264
Speaker 4: Yeah, I'm trying to come up with the truth that would have to, like, get us.

69
00:14:09,244 --> 00:14:10,844
Speaker 3: We cannot, like, guess.

70
00:14:11,554 --> 00:14:11,994
Speaker 4: Yeah.

71
00:14:12,094 --> 00:14:16,214
Speaker 3: Because you can give one. We just know a lot of them. Right. They would love that.

72
00:14:20,454 --> 00:14:24,954
Speaker 4: Two lies and a truth? Give you guys better chances. 

73
00:14:35,184 --> 00:14:43,274
Speaker 3: You didn't know it was going to be so hard. Yeah.

74
00:14:45,314 --> 00:14:49,354
Speaker 4: Because it's coming up with nothing. Like, starting with nothing.

75
00:14:49,654 --> 00:14:51,134
Speaker 7: That would make a problem.

76
00:14:56,994 --> 00:15:05,756
Speaker 1: Could you all just give us a sign or something, Steve? What's that? Couldn't you have just given us an assignment? I know. Paperwork. Somebody might have got that.

77
00:15:09,426 --> 00:15:23,676
Speaker 3: I actually don't, but I feel like mostly women. I married my high school sweetheart. I was supposed to be, like, my career dream originally was to be a nurse. 

78
00:15:24,336 --> 00:15:27,256
Speaker 2: and I have camped at all of the Michigan State Units.

79
00:15:28,866 --> 00:15:29,726
Speaker 8: That reference is great.

80
00:15:32,216 --> 00:15:42,726
Speaker 7: You can just put it in there and just throw it in there. Sure. That's ambiguous enough, but I don't want to do it. Can't tell you.

81
00:15:49,066 --> 00:15:57,536
Speaker 1: I'm just going to be a nurse. Well, you remember that if you were calling me a lie.

82
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:14,930
Speaker 2: I play the game that night. All of us? I'm going to say the third one. I don't think we know. Yeah, third. I think we've done, we did almost third. Wow. That's a lot. It was our goal for a while. How many are there? A lot.

83
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:21,860
Speaker 3: Oh, boy. The ones that we could, that I counted that we could bring our family time. That's awesome.

84
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,360
Steve Muniak: Nurse. 

85
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,640
Speaker 3: No, it was the state parks.

86
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,300
Steve Muniak: Oh, it was the state parks? Yes. Oh, sorry.

87
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:45,960
Speaker 3: I was supposed to be a nurse. I had appendicitis my last May, my senior year. And I had this vivid moment that I was in the hospital and the nurses were so nice. And I was like, I'm not this nice. And I had to change everything. And then I went and got a finance degree instead.

88
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:46,860
Speaker 4: Wow.

89
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:47,820
Speaker 2: If you're using it.

90
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,480
Speaker 4: Yeah. That's it.

91
00:16:52,390 --> 00:17:12,642
Speaker 2: Okay, I feel like black people aren't allowed to answer this. I know. That's what I'm having trouble with. I can't get a story that you guys are not. So I guess the people that I work with. Yes. Okay. Let's see. I worked at Hot Topic in the mall when I was in high school. I have a 21-year-old daughter, and I have 10 tattoos.

92
00:17:14,872 --> 00:17:27,202
Speaker 8: Hot Topic. That's going to sound like Hot Topic. Yeah, I was just thinking that. I was just thinking that you said it. What do you do at Hot Topic. 

93
00:17:28,222 --> 00:17:46,122
Speaker 2: What I do at Hot Topic? Yeah. I sell clothes, fold all the time. Was it because of you being my emo, because I'm a huge Nirvana fan? So, you know, being my whole Kurt Cobain era of life. My angst. I just love my Junko jeans and big t-shirts.

94
00:17:46,322 --> 00:17:50,652
Speaker 7: And this is very legal, yeah. I've worked at Hot Topic.

95
00:17:50,872 --> 00:18:17,294
Speaker 3: Of course I worked at Hot Topic. My mother would have never. I know. My nephew had to dress up for soccer, and he gets to the school, and she works at the school. And he was wearing his dad's pants, because it was all good and fine, and I was like, do they look like dick cookies? We're awake. Then you have to look it up.

96
00:18:18,754 --> 00:18:19,774
Speaker 7: I'm like, what does that mean. 

97
00:18:20,404 --> 00:18:39,574
Speaker 1: Andy, you're a tattooist. What do you think she does? I think she has some more. What do you think she has? I'm going to say it's a tattoo thing, because it's... Well, I have. They're all pretty good.

98
00:19:00,096 --> 00:19:13,776
Speaker 1: So we're all like, yeah, she's like, oh, they're going to totally think I'm going to get a hot dog. Actually, we're like, no, she's got more tips.

99
00:19:13,836 --> 00:19:28,486
Speaker 2: I've got more tips. No, I have 10, so, yeah. And then along with the 21-year-old daughter, I have a nine and almost seven-year-old stepson. That's a good one.

100
00:19:29,286 --> 00:19:56,836
Speaker 1: Okay. I can go next if somebody wants me. So you can see that people aren't ready. I'm like, good, good, okay. All right, I'm trying to keep these thematic. But the longest I've run is 50 miles. The fastest I've completed a marathon is three hours and 45 minutes. And the longest I've been awake is 60 hours. Oh, wow.

101
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:07,710
Speaker 4: I was going to say, I don't know, maybe the, would you say 50 hours? 50 miles? 50 miles.

102
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:16,270
Speaker 1: The furthest I've run is 50 miles. The longest I've been away is 60 hours. The fastest marathon is 3 hours and 45 minutes. I really hope it's the awakening.

103
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,980
Speaker 4: I don't think it is. Yeah, I think that's the truth. I think you start to go crazy.

104
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:29,000
Jake Herwaldt: Oh, I think he would push that barrier down. I think he'd like to go crazy. Yeah, someone would be like, you can't do four days. It's 10 days. Five days. How many days is that. 

105
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:33,980
Speaker 4: Your brain starts shutting down after three days. Ooh, it's the science. Literally going to insanity.

106
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:39,320
Jake Herwaldt: He's like, I've been riding a half steam this whole time. Every penny sticks. We're drunk at all.

107
00:20:39,380 --> 00:21:00,331
Speaker 1: No. We're just. We're drunk at all. No drugs were involved in any of these unless you consider caffeine. All right. I think it's number two. What was number two? Oh, marathon runs. I'm going to go one. Is that the 50 miles? 50 miles. 50 miles. 

108
00:21:02,611 --> 00:21:03,131
Speaker 4: Same.

109
00:21:03,312 --> 00:21:34,202
Speaker 1: Yeah. The answer is my fastest marathon is 3 hours and 40 minutes. I technically never signed up for a marathon. I've only done longer races, and so my fastest marathon is like 6 hours on the road to 50 hours. But I have stayed up to 60 hours. Was that for the race? No. It was for fun.

110
00:21:34,502 --> 00:22:04,623
Speaker 1: Oh, man. 50 miles. It was an event I did in 2019, it was a 50 plus, 52 hours of it was this event put on by ex-Navy SEALs and current Navy SEALs, and then I was up before it, and I stayed up after I finished it. And I remember thinking after I got done, I was like, I'm going to get 60 hours. I don't remember the last hour, so they had to put me to bed to get me.

111
00:22:04,903 --> 00:22:08,754
Speaker 1: Because there were some guys who took care of us after we were done.

112
00:22:09,514 --> 00:22:20,514
Speaker 3: Is that the author, the Navy SEAL guy that wrote... Jocko. No, no. Never finished. There's a book, never finished. The one that drops off songs all the time. It's a great book, though.

113
00:22:21,504 --> 00:22:23,224
Speaker 1: Are you talking about Goggins. 

114
00:22:23,464 --> 00:22:24,423
Speaker 3: Yes, David Goggins.

115
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:27,183
Speaker 1: Yes, I listened to Can't Hurt Me.

116
00:22:27,303 --> 00:22:27,643
Speaker 3: Okay.

117
00:22:28,043 --> 00:22:30,583
Speaker 1: While I was training for it. Yeah.

118
00:22:31,274 --> 00:22:33,893
Speaker 3: That book made me want to wake up with badass.

119
00:22:34,214 --> 00:23:04,415
Speaker 1: Yeah. It was sort of a... I turned 30, and I was trying to look at what would make... I looked at 40-year-olds, and I was not... I was trying to look at a pattern of what 40-year-olds were enjoying their life, and what 40-year-olds were sort of like was happening to them. And I decided my best life wasn't going to be the path of Jesus' choices, and I had to, on how to make uncomfortable choices before our time.

120
00:23:07,945 --> 00:23:38,355
Speaker 1: It just so happened that I wanted to make 60 hours because I wanted to make 60 hours. Your brain is different. But you'd be surprised at the power of sunlight. Once you get the first, like your brain at 3 AM is very groggy, messed up. But sunlight triggers your cycle to be like, oh, it's time to get up. So you can kind of get through. And even the second night we went through,

121
00:23:38,435 --> 00:23:49,915
Speaker 1: my brain roughly 40 hours versus 48, and the sunlight hit again. Oh, yeah, I can be awake now. All right, I'm ready.

122
00:23:51,655 --> 00:24:00,679
Speaker 4: I have been to two other continents. I'm an avid skateboarder, and I've ran, Two tough ones.

123
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:02,549
Speaker 8: What counties. 

124
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,919
Speaker 4: Can I tell that. 

125
00:24:06,769 --> 00:24:11,929
Speaker 1: Sure. Are these your counties? I'm reading your micro-expressions.

126
00:24:12,029 --> 00:24:29,539
Speaker 4: Africa and Australia. What kind of skateboard do you like? The long flat boarder. The long boarder. It might be that one.

127
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,929
Speaker 2: I don't know. Or she wants to think that.

128
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:40,799
Speaker 3: You won't know if I tell you. The real long one. There is difference. I don't know.

129
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:09,671
Speaker 4: absolutely hate but jumping off the 30 foot ledge is the most fun because it's also the most.

130
00:25:09,671 --> 00:25:46,631
Speaker 1: frightening she's definitely done some of those hominins oh no that's funny okay good i agree that yeah i think that's probably that's like 11 anybody who says they like to drive is probably like it's not the cold and i did both of them in the rain in like 40 degree weather it's stupid thing they still hold this yeah it's just the long board of the skate i'm gonna go.

131
00:25:46,631 --> 00:25:59,791
Speaker 2: i was gonna think that that's you yeah get in my head it's like you should tell them what you aren't instead of skateboarding though vicky what actually do you do the um the.

132
00:26:00,063 --> 00:26:29,393
Speaker 4: The reason for going to other continents was for rifle shooting. I used to be on the United States Rifle Shooting Team. Whoa. I was on a vice captain. How far away can you hit me at a run? Do you want to find out? So competition-wise, per competition, it was 800 to 1,000 yards. That is a long way. And we had no scopes. It was just .

133
00:26:30,093 --> 00:26:34,913
Speaker 1: Iron sights. That's crazy. How big of a target are you hitting at. 

134
00:26:36,653 --> 00:26:47,383
Speaker 4: So it was, I think the whole target was 12 by 12. That's long. So feet.

135
00:26:48,343 --> 00:26:49,143
Speaker 7: Feet, OK.

136
00:26:49,363 --> 00:26:49,903
Jake Herwaldt: I would have figured.

137
00:26:51,003 --> 00:26:58,123
Speaker 4: Because you can hold out your arms, and you wouldn't be able to touch the 308 rifle.

138
00:27:00,095 --> 00:27:13,195
Speaker 1: I grew up in, like, my grandpa was in the military, so I've read a lot of military things. So when I used to walk in from the big parking lot, I knew the snipers could hit me from the parking lot. I was, like, pacing it out, like, that's not even hard for them. No. That's bad. It's a long ways.

139
00:27:13,555 --> 00:27:26,855
Steve Muniak: Anybody ever been to the D. Lee book? No. In Dallas? Oh, no. It's a, it's, it was shooting the, wow, literally, you just, you see it, you walk, you get up to that window, you look down, it says, oh, yeah, he hit him.

140
00:27:28,215 --> 00:27:58,115
Speaker 3: See, do you remember, this is random, we were at Kid Rock Bar in Nashville. It was a bunch of people from the industry. Which time I met you. Was that the first time? Yeah. And there were snipers at the building across the street, and so from the bar, it just had open walls. You could look, and you could see the buildings across the street, and there were men dressed in full tactical gear, all black, with rifles. And, like, downtown Nashville's insane, right? So it's people everywhere partying, and you're just, like, sitting there. And I was so nervous, because I'm, like, from the country, so I'm, like, oh, my God. What happened to me? Protecting the people. No way.

141
00:27:58,755 --> 00:28:19,569
Speaker 3: I'm really surprised. I think. There had been, like, some shootings, and I think they were literally there to respond. Be a presence. Yeah. Which was a good thing. On one level, I'm like, but it was just unsettling. Everyone's having a time and dancing, and I'm just like, oh, my God. Well, that was on the road. That's great.

142
00:28:22,289 --> 00:28:53,709
Speaker 1: Jordan? Am I the last one? Yes. All right. I had to type mine out, too, because it took me forever to figure it out. I gave up on, like, block people knowing, because it's hard. I grew up on a blueberry farm. My first job in high school was at a library, and I was a drummer in a band in high school. It's all very believable. Can you do a little rhythm for me? A little rhythm for you? I like how he's taking it. What was it?

143
00:28:53,709 --> 00:28:59,909
Speaker 1: I played drums, and I gave up. What kind of band was it? It was a, like, punk rock band, alternative. Okay. Can you give us a swing?

144
00:29:23,981 --> 00:29:51,741
Speaker 1: I was making that up. I don't remember anything. I think you were a blueberry guy, so I don't get a line about that. What was the number two one again? What was the one you sandwiched in the middle? My first job in high school was at a library. I was talking about your second job. How egregious should the lie be, right? I do kind of feel like you were in a punk band. I think. Not because of what you did, that was not the answer.

145
00:29:56,951 --> 00:30:21,203
Speaker 1: Nobody would have mentioned that. I don't know. I wasn't a punk fan, but I played guitar in a punk band. That's what I thought. You played guitar. You were sneaky. Yeah. Sneaky. Only a small lie there. Too funny. The funny thing, too, is I worked at the library that was like two houses down from Vicky's grandparents' house. Oh, my gosh. And I didn't meet Vicky until I went to church with Vicky's grandparents and never met Vicky until I went to block.

146
00:30:21,703 --> 00:30:22,883
Speaker 3: I worked with Vicky's grandpa.

147
00:30:23,143 --> 00:30:23,803
Speaker 1: Did you really. 

148
00:30:24,023 --> 00:30:28,923
Speaker 3: Yeah. I loved him. He was like an art. Riffle art. He was like my favorite person that I knew. He was so good.

149
00:30:29,083 --> 00:30:30,043
Speaker 1: Where were you working at. 

150
00:30:30,243 --> 00:30:30,743
Speaker 3: At the Mac.

151
00:30:31,003 --> 00:30:31,703
Speaker 1: Okay. Yeah.

152
00:30:31,823 --> 00:30:34,773
Speaker 3: That's awesome. Yeah, the connections are weird.

153
00:30:34,893 --> 00:30:51,623
Speaker 4: My grandpa loved the city and like the community and he knew everybody. What was that place in Mason that was like the older folks' home? It's right down Jefferson. Welcome.

154
00:30:54,213 --> 00:31:01,505
Steve Muniak: So, Steve, did you acquire enough information to use this against us on the beach? I didn't know anybody, just a little bit better. Where some of the weaknesses are.

155
00:31:03,355 --> 00:31:13,635
Speaker 1: We're bad at lying. If that's a weakness. I mean, I play clarinet.

156
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:33,985
Speaker 3: I play the viola. I'm out. You can do the triangle. I can play half cross buzz on the recorder. I just practiced it the other day. My daughter was on her recorder and I was like, I bet you I can still fuck that half cross buzz. Did you have the practice. 

157
00:31:38,515 --> 00:31:38,935
Speaker 8: Alright.

158
00:31:40,075 --> 00:32:06,739
Speaker 1: Okay. I still have a second lunch to finish, but I'll get there. What you'll see on the board, the wall, is in fact, the world's greatest post-it note of workflows. Well, the goal of that, do you think so? No, no. This isn't the whole workflow. This is just the first five.

159
00:32:07,219 --> 00:32:10,959
Speaker 4: Do we name the workflow or all of the steps in the process. 

160
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:42,479
Speaker 1: No, no, no, just the name. So my goal is that we, I think that reasonably fit seven workflows if we write legibly. Oh, and if we keep them in post-it. No, we don't even need to keep them. I don't mind actually writing them not post-it. Okay. Because, and if you guys have, like, I think that can fit. I'll even put on there, I'll write the numbers on there so we stay within. I don't mind if there are eight. I just know we have said, we believe that there are five, and we might be right, we might be wrong.

161
00:32:42,779 --> 00:33:03,371
Speaker 1: I just want to hear from your perspective what those are. So we'll just say for sure there's two, three, four, five, six. Look at that. You got spacing. Do you go beyond seven? If you go beyond seven, you can just write on that. It's an extension of the world's greatest business.

162
00:33:03,991 --> 00:33:20,111
Jake Herwaldt: Andy, can you give us an example of a workflow so that we can hone this out? Oh, yeah. Can you give me an example? External buyer. An external buyer workflow. OK, yeah. External. Just a little example, that way we know.

163
00:33:20,311 --> 00:33:33,191
Speaker 1: So you want this high level. Yes. We are going to next. Yes. OK. So the external buyer process could be 20, 30 mini workflows, or 10, which this is where you're going to think people.

164
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:37,071
Jake Herwaldt: You can think teams. You can think, and you might want.

165
00:33:37,071 --> 00:33:52,161
Speaker 1: to say the external buyer purchasing thing. Part. Anybody who wants to. You guys don't, but I would. Oh, if you have good handwriting, or are we going to. 

166
00:33:52,301 --> 00:33:58,421
Speaker 3: I get good handwriting. OK. And I can write it. It's probably not even like yours. I love tangents.

167
00:33:58,481 --> 00:34:09,783
Speaker 1: It's going to go a while. Just tell us what it is, because we're going to try to compare it to here. And we're trying to, because if we're right about our five, then we're not trying to make more. We're just going to not give you our five.

168
00:34:10,063 --> 00:34:12,023
Speaker 3: OK. Well, I would follow that up with internal buyer.

169
00:34:13,753 --> 00:34:15,653
Jake Herwaldt: Look at that. Internalized.

170
00:34:16,033 --> 00:34:21,233
Speaker 4: Well, there's two different, three different kinds of internal buyers. But that's what you're saying, like, we do later.

171
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:26,683
Steve Muniak: Well, that's what's, hopefully, the light to the park captured some of the, yeah, team complexity for that.

172
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:49,823
Speaker 3: Yeah. Do you like our . It's beautiful. It's a lot, because I'll look at that more, errors, but it's good. I'm just here, so we're good. Yeah, externals under internals.

173
00:34:57,753 --> 00:34:59,753
Jake Herwaldt: Are they right? Ding, ding, ding.

174
00:35:07,415 --> 00:35:14,905
Speaker 4: Did your wife pick out that Tupperware size? That's why it's working. I do it with my kids.

175
00:35:20,855 --> 00:35:22,795
Speaker 3: Would this be like the vendor data management. 

176
00:35:24,185 --> 00:35:27,445
Jake Herwaldt: I don't know fully what those words mean, but write it up. Let's do it.

177
00:35:30,705 --> 00:35:35,725
Speaker 4: So what kind of workflows are we? Are we talking about like sourcing window reaching workflows. 

178
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:38,075
Jake Herwaldt: Yes. Sorry. Good. Yeah. Good.

179
00:35:38,115 --> 00:35:41,755
Speaker 4: These are users. Are we... Yeah. We're talking about user groups. ... too high for workflow. 

180
00:35:42,915 --> 00:36:08,119
Speaker 1: I think so. I think we... I realize that... These are experiences. Yeah. The external buyer... I'm assuming what we meant by that is the external buyer purchasing a part of sourcing, window pro. Yeah. The internal buyer... purchasing a part of it there. So maybe if we, we don't have a verb there. We probably need to add external buyer for purchasing.

181
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:24,449
Speaker 3: Can you put S-O-V-P next to external buyer? So that doesn't make only one internal buyer. This persona has multiple . Yes, they all have multiple workflows.

182
00:36:24,449 --> 00:36:39,209
Jake Herwaldt: And that's fine, that's fine. This is actually more focused on the user than the workflow. We're going to do workflows for the users. Yes, sorry. So this is identifying essentially the users. All in the pockets of people.

183
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:39,929
Speaker 1: Okay.

184
00:36:40,049 --> 00:36:44,929
Jake Herwaldt: So you have external buyer, great. We will then branch off to see all the 20,000 things.

185
00:36:44,989 --> 00:36:46,109
Speaker 1: Why did I use the word workflows then. 

186
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:54,209
Jake Herwaldt: I don't know, that's fine. Do you want to go more? We will then, we are going to the next step is to then create the workflow. Can you call it personas? You can correct that, yeah.

187
00:36:54,429 --> 00:36:55,269
Speaker 3: Okay, that makes sense.

188
00:36:56,799 --> 00:36:59,479
Jake Herwaldt: Personas. Could you write it a little taller. 

189
00:37:06,411 --> 00:37:11,911
Speaker 1: That's a good point though, we can use our personas, and see if you said actors, because that's the language you guys use.

190
00:37:12,531 --> 00:37:18,991
Steve Muniak: It's just another form, it doesn't matter. I'm asking because personas is a little bit easier to use. Yeah, personas is fine. Makes sense. Right. 

191
00:37:21,681 --> 00:37:34,101
Speaker 3: Yeah, I guess for a word post, you have your admin. Correct. Or like your super user, and then you have your, we don't have the words for this yet, because we don't have it currently. Yeah. I would say maybe admin and user being the two designators. And that would be for the...

192
00:37:34,101 --> 00:37:43,851
Speaker 4: That would be for both. That would be for all of them. Because Jordan and I and Steve, we're going to be the admin, internal admin.

193
00:37:44,231 --> 00:37:47,551
Steve Muniak: But those are roles within, those are roles within...

194
00:37:47,551 --> 00:37:48,611
Speaker 4: We don't fit in any of those.

195
00:37:49,911 --> 00:37:52,091
Steve Muniak: Yeah, there's a management role. Mm-hmm.

196
00:37:52,171 --> 00:37:53,271
Speaker 4: Okay, so that makes sense.

197
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:54,431
Speaker 3: It would be in the persona.

198
00:37:54,791 --> 00:37:55,331
Steve Muniak: What's that. 

199
00:37:55,551 --> 00:37:57,091
Speaker 3: It would be under the persona, right. 

200
00:37:57,451 --> 00:38:01,543
Steve Muniak: Yes, there's a management persona, internal management persona. So I'm gonna add an external management persona.

201
00:38:01,843 --> 00:38:02,263
Jake Herwaldt: Yeah.

202
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:04,473
Speaker 3: Okay, so is that five and six. 

203
00:38:04,473 --> 00:38:14,423
Jake Herwaldt: That's like five and six. Okay. Because they're essentially, they own the hierarchy then. Yeah. Because that's like an external vendor would be like the person who's doing.

204
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:18,393
Speaker 3: I'm looking at external vendor, all parts.

205
00:38:18,553 --> 00:38:18,873
Jake Herwaldt: Right.

206
00:38:18,873 --> 00:38:43,623
Speaker 3: And then under all parts, you have whoever is administrating the account and then you have users. So it feels like those are sub-items that go under the ring. Yeah, that's fine. Okay, so I'm gonna call it admin user. Yeah, we can even name that. That's the two different levels, correct? Yeah. Is that for all of them? Yes.

207
00:38:53,003 --> 00:38:54,003
Speaker 8: Okay, so yes.

208
00:39:04,035 --> 00:39:22,215
Speaker 3: What if you call out a field service, different than for a buyer? That's where you could argue it would still be an SWP buyer, but it would be a completely different profile. I think it should be a different persona. I would actually like that with a five. Like, number of questions.

209
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:28,415
Speaker 4: Well, external buyer users? Are we going to split users. 

210
00:39:29,175 --> 00:39:56,345
Speaker 3: We could do that as a profile type under, yeah. Like, there's the procurement team, but then there's a field service engineer. And I feel like a procurement user, is going to have different work than a field service engineer. Absolutely. Yeah. So I would agree. I would think that admin user should this be external buyer. Oh, sorry. So admin, should it be FSC and then procurement? Yeah.

211
00:40:03,709 --> 00:40:11,829
Speaker 8: like FSE and internally we would have the same, right. 

212
00:40:12,509 --> 00:40:14,309
Speaker 4: Would we set that up for our FSE. 

213
00:40:14,349 --> 00:40:15,889
Steve Muniak: On the buy side, yeah.

214
00:40:23,019 --> 00:40:30,979
Speaker 8: Maybe like the event is the copy of the FSE.

215
00:40:34,539 --> 00:40:46,809
Speaker 4: There's not like an overall system or portal management like up there right now.

216
00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:50,069
Steve Muniak: But it's part of the administrative function, I think.

217
00:40:50,459 --> 00:40:52,719
Speaker 4: But it wouldn't fit under vendor or buyer.

218
00:40:52,959 --> 00:40:58,679
Speaker 3: Yeah, because we're saying block imaging is just another customer. We need to talk about pitting that as like an ad.

219
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:04,881
Jake Herwaldt: Mm-hmm. Yeah. What would you call that? You'd call that like a platform admin? Yeah.

220
00:41:05,102 --> 00:41:05,981
Steve Muniak: That's exactly right.

221
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:44,582
Speaker 3: Would you park Biomed out differently, or have that live under external buyers and external lenders? Because that would also be completely different profile type. And, though, just throwing this in there, too, you would have buyers that would need to do both DI and Biomed. It would be very different. I would say Biomed.

222
00:41:44,741 --> 00:41:45,622
Speaker 3: Every single one of them. OK.

223
00:41:53,711 --> 00:42:15,104
Jake Herwaldt: So then once we have these, and I'm not saying we're done, but once we have these fully defined now, then we would double click into one of them. And then now Spiderweb out to say, okay, what are all the... And then we'll get to what's in scope, out of scope, but essentially what are they doing within the platform, outside the platform. Do we feel like this is the list. 

224
00:42:16,874 --> 00:42:19,574
Speaker 4: I think so. For our first take, is it the list. 

225
00:42:19,694 --> 00:42:27,283
Jake Herwaldt: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now of this, which of all of us that are in the room, who's all going to be in the room tomorrow, Steve. 

226
00:42:27,703 --> 00:42:29,044
Steve Muniak: Tomorrow is going to be the five people.

227
00:42:29,183 --> 00:42:40,734
Jake Herwaldt: Okay, good. So who should we focus on of this list today with our... How much time do we have? Three hours. We'll hopefully get through several of these.

228
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:49,493
Speaker 4: I'd love external buyer. Okay. I think that's going to be the biggest one that tomorrow they're as focused on.

229
00:42:49,594 --> 00:43:14,496
Jake Herwaldt: Right. Okay, great. So I have what our first shot at trying to define this, which again is not meant to be us actually... getting this correct, but just as a starting point. So now what we're going to want to do, invert this to sticky notes, confirm, mark this up, do whatever you want. But yeah, we'll probably slap .

230
00:43:21,596 --> 00:43:52,736
Speaker 1: Here's the rule I want to impose. I want to give you guys a few minutes to look this over. And you can use a marker, you can use a pen, you can do whatever you want. But find something wrong. You can't find something wrong with it. Find the thing that elicits the most emotional response, whether it's joy, because it's such a wonderful thing, or it's frustration, because it's.

231
00:43:52,736 --> 00:44:27,580
Speaker 1: something that's not wonderful. Then make a note, and then. Or if it's wrong, obviously, make a note. We're going to want to repair it and fix it going forward. I've never felt so old in my life. Jake said that all of you guys would have no problem making this, because he doesn't have a problem making this. I'm just teasing. He asked me, is this OK? I don't know. But here's the rule that I would like to impose on you guys.

232
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:57,880
Speaker 1: I would like you to always have at least two post-it notes in front of you that have something on it, either something that you're going to eventually add. Either it's going to be a point of frustration, or it's going to be an idea that you have, or it's going to be some piece of information, so that when we get to the thing where your note applies to you, you're ready to put it up there. Here's why. Because once we get into a rhythm of this, you might question whether or not.

233
00:45:00,152 --> 00:45:32,222
Speaker 1: What was that thing I thought of? So if you always have two, if that's the rule, to always have two up there, you're kind of always ready to bring that up. And it's also just a good practice. I might get three or four things up there when you look at it. And it gets us in the habit of everybody, participating in building this out. Probably going to put another two out there, because that might not wrap it all the way across. Ideas? It could be ideas. It could be corrections to this. It could be, I have a story to tell about this thing.

234
00:45:32,222 --> 00:45:46,382
Speaker 1: because it's not right. This is going to need more information. Please use the Sharpies on the post-it notes. You can use whatever you want on your diaries. Does that make sense? Any questions about that. 

235
00:45:48,532 --> 00:45:58,972
Jake Herwaldt: So we will continue. I'm sure we'll continue to fight the idea of we want to focus on current state, but also focus on future at the same time. And so, yeah, just keep both of those in mind.

236
00:46:09,114 --> 00:46:19,494
Speaker 3: can you tell me the difference visually in like the top row is a bunch of red arrows except for creating a recognition what was the designator basically the.

237
00:46:19,494 --> 00:46:27,174
Jake Herwaldt: idea is with creating a new rec you're actually doing that thing the rest are just kind of screens they kind of see information on so yes we'll want to.

238
00:46:27,174 --> 00:46:59,804
Speaker 8: define those but the complexity I would assume you said you were gonna be done.

239
00:47:07,126 --> 00:47:09,206
Speaker 1: We're really just biding our time.

240
00:47:11,926 --> 00:47:25,066
Steve Muniak: Can you say, let's say, within my capabilities, what does that mean? Can you call out where? Decision box after pool SRC view within my capabilities.

241
00:47:27,296 --> 00:47:28,716
Speaker 4: Is that what you mean. 

242
00:47:33,066 --> 00:47:41,796
Jake Herwaldt: Am I on the right one? Oh, no. Zoom back out. It's under vendor. Sorry.

243
00:47:45,346 --> 00:47:46,046
Speaker 8: There we go.

244
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:12,470
Speaker 4: So your homework that you assigned to us last week, can we incorporate some of that into this. 

245
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:13,690
Speaker 1: What was the homework that I assigned. 

246
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:18,780
Speaker 4: It was like five questions. You said if we wrote it down, we'd get extra points.

247
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,040
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. Did you write it down? Oh.

248
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:22,500
Speaker 4: Nice.

249
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:54,010
Speaker 1: So this is my race. This is my brilliant plan. We want to do extra credit, though. Right. You said we'd get a thing. This is so, I always hope for 100% participation, and yet I realize that I don't want to shame people who didn't participate. Oh, okay. Who are saying, I see. Judge me. Yes, this is exactly where those things are. This is the same philosophy, which is take some time,

250
00:48:54,010 --> 00:49:16,672
Speaker 1: look it over, write things down. When we get in the flow of the conversation, it is meant to either accelerate us, because we get to a point where we're like, rather than stop it because somebody else has an idea. Or it's meant to get us distracted on a new thing to make sure we didn't lose it. There's a handful of reasons why getting it written down and getting it on the board preps us. But your sheet should be full of basically these sticking.

251
00:51:18,416 --> 00:51:21,196
Steve Muniak: Check with these guys, we have room till 5.

252
00:51:23,826 --> 00:51:27,436
Speaker 4: I'm like, I've reached my limitation, gang.

253
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:44,716
Speaker 7: I'm like, I can't ask, let me go somewhere else. All the awesomeness.

254
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:30,520
Speaker 1: I don't want to necessarily force you guys to read through until you map out every single thing. I don't mind us going through. But I just wanted to make sure you guys have time to have some thoughts, have some interruptions. Again, this was, actually, Jake, do you want to go through, just give us a brief how you built up this workflow so that they know what they're competing against. 

255
00:52:30,760 --> 00:53:04,592
Jake Herwaldt: JAKE ARCHIBALD O' Yeah, essentially, this is taking a compilation of everything that we got from the RFP, from the videos that we got sent, from trying to think of where it ended. It didn't take into any consideration anything that we talked about last Wednesday. But basically, from there, trying to create a web of what is the flow based, on all of those materials. And so, again, there could be clear gaps in this. There could be just ways. oversimplifying of things and then this is this is meant to be current states.

256
00:53:04,592 --> 00:53:11,292
Jake Herwaldt: and then so this is not ideating at all but that doesn't mean we can't talk.

257
00:53:11,292 --> 00:53:15,692
Speaker 3: about it so this would be like when you go to the version you have now that's.

258
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:42,232
Speaker 1: right now right but we can have that can totally be yeah we do need to be sticky note it can be figure me something here we'll just start don't not think about it don't think about us because that's gonna be part of the everything we do in terms of categorizing things and saying oh this is a direct extension we'll want to make sure when we're building this we're keeping this in mind so do not but.

259
00:53:43,282 --> 00:54:13,224
Jake Herwaldt: Steve and team let's keep in mind obviously we only have three hours not even anymore of these workflows which ones would we like to get through if we get through fewer that's fine that gives us more time to like to find future state but I don't want to, If you get stuck on one, if you guys are like, oh, shoot, based on who's in the room today, we should probably get through four of the five. Or if we only need to get two of the five through today based on who we have, like, then let's take our time.

260
00:54:14,384 --> 00:54:30,064
Steve Muniak: So tomorrow morning we've got the self-divide. We'll have to get them up to speed a little bit on some of these. Okay. And then I know Vicki's here tomorrow after. Allie, what's your available tomorrow. 

261
00:54:31,314 --> 00:54:41,674
Speaker 2: I'm available tomorrow. I believe it's three today. I will also be here in the morning. I'm available all day.

262
00:54:42,084 --> 00:54:45,204
Jake Herwaldt: We'll be here in the morning as well. So of those items, which is best. 

263
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:48,864
Speaker 3: I think external buyer still because the procurement team would be internal buyer.

264
00:54:49,044 --> 00:54:51,664
Jake Herwaldt: Great. So external buyer.

265
00:54:51,944 --> 00:54:56,524
Speaker 3: Would be the number one. And then I would say external vendor for number two, wouldn't you think. 

266
00:54:57,484 --> 00:54:58,024
Steve Muniak: For today.

267
00:54:58,724 --> 00:55:00,024
Speaker 3: If you're both today, that would be.

268
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:30,416
Steve Muniak: Let me set the stage a little bit, too, for internal buyers before we go too far down here. Yeah. Internal buyers, the only screen they're working out of is in Salesforce 3. So it's, you know, the internal buyers and internal vendor are all working in 360. So Allie's team is only working in 360. That's all they do when they're selling a product or sourcing a product.

269
00:55:30,936 --> 00:55:46,116
Steve Muniak: The internal buyer is only working in 360. They see nothing else. And I've been trying, noodling in my notebook, trying to give you guys a better diagram of what systems they reside in. Great.

270
00:55:48,496 --> 00:56:05,480
Speaker 1: Is that visible enough? No. No? Not at all yet. All right. I hate it, too. I'm glad you guys spoke up. I was testing you. It's an internal buyer, so I'm thinking of it. the right thing based on the video you put out. Is this any of this auto sourcing kind of flow? Is this internal. 

271
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,420
Speaker 3: Everything, hey, everything's auto sourced.

272
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:19,160
Speaker 1: So it's currently in Salesforce. Are you guys also thinking that it would stay in Salesforce going forward, or are we gonna move some of this to, are we thinking about moving some of this to the new stuff? I assume you're moving some of this, that's the kind of ask.

273
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:34,500
Steve Muniak: And it's my question for Sam. I know. As you have described this project internally as it started happening, what kind of changes to 360 or the 360 two. 

274
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:49,400
Speaker 3: In a perfect world, and I could be like massively, oversimplifying this, so you'll have to tell me. If you think about what we're trying to build as a package that could be our stock as its own business, I just see, I feel like the flow behind sourcing has to, or I'll take this.

275
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:52,730
Jake Herwaldt: Even for an internal person. 

276
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:59,990
Speaker 3: Absolutely. Because what we're saying is we can manage this for you, customer, from a vendor perspective, or from a customer perspective, but the logic all lives here in the. 

277
00:57:38,202 --> 00:57:54,302
Steve Muniak: So, again, if I'm Andy Jarvis, he's a guy, are you saying that Andy would then be using a web interface, or Andy would know that he's using a web interface? That. He would not know.

278
00:57:54,702 --> 00:58:10,924
Speaker 3: Yep. So he would be in his flow. He wouldn't even know he's using a web interface. The web interface is giving him access to how it's sourcing, whether it's like the tiered vendors. It did do the vendor management when it comes to sourcing, not like the human vendor management.

279
00:58:11,144 --> 00:58:11,444
Steve Muniak: Yes.

280
00:58:11,914 --> 00:58:12,674
Speaker 3: It's very different.

281
00:58:14,374 --> 00:58:24,474
Steve Muniak: Yeah. This is some stuff we're going to have to really dig into, because there's a lot of complexity within the roles of that internal buyer.

282
00:58:25,094 --> 00:58:28,794
Speaker 4: Yeah, that'll be a good conversation. Especially on the FSE side. Yeah.

283
00:58:29,254 --> 00:58:34,254
Speaker 1: They could use some better structure and simplicity, at the same time.

284
00:58:34,314 --> 00:58:43,264
Speaker 3: And that's why, if you bring that in, as its own profile, and give them access to it, we might have to build it differently. But it would be awesome to have that.

285
00:58:43,974 --> 00:58:45,714
Jake Herwaldt: Who you're hoping, I guess. 

286
00:58:47,894 --> 00:59:18,596
Speaker 1: I want to, I think this could just, take a second and help us be more visually organized. When an external buyer signs on to the org, switches tabs to this thing. What are the three phrases they're saying? So I'm going to put words in your mouth, because I just want to get these out, because I think they're going to be the starters for when we go. Because we know it's all one workflow of it. I need a part, and I have to get something to do with it.

287
00:59:18,656 --> 00:59:40,346
Speaker 1: But the first phrase is, I need a part. That is the first phrase somebody says in their brain, and they go there. And then the second one is, I need to check on responses. Yeah, right? I need to, like, I made my, like, let's, let's, there's these different, like, I need to go back.

288
00:59:40,486 --> 00:59:42,766
Speaker 3: The second thing would be, like, I have a lot of options here.

289
00:59:43,236 --> 00:59:53,906
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, yeah, options, I have options here. I need to choose which vendor. Yeah, yeah, thank you. I need to choose a vendor. And then the next one would be. I need to submit my order.
