1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:15,440
Jake Herwaldt: That's what I mean. I want to accomplish phase one, phase two. I want to accomplish talking through, have we talked through all of the items that they've marked as required? That's what I'm thinking, I'm going to go super quickly and slip through it.

2
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,440
Nathan Bedford: and mark out one that we haven't talked about.

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:23,680
Andrew Bailey: Oh yeah, definitely. We just did that. Would that be the worthwhile thing, is to build with buckets. 

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,100
Jake Herwaldt: That's huge, I mean that's, if we haven't talked about a thing, we need to.

5
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,160
Andrew Bailey: Is that worth saying. 

6
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,070
Jake Herwaldt: We don't, just do two slash three, because we don't know yet.

7
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:56,790
Andrew Bailey: Yeah, that's what I was going to do. Really, it's just, yeah, it's a little parking lot. Because I feel like you could just list them off and I could just be like. Yeah, yeah, it's 118, so I don't think we're going to do. Oh, we're not doing the original list. 

8
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:57,310
Nathan Bedford: Well I think. 

9
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,610
Andrew Bailey: No, yeah, it's way bigger.

10
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,052
Nathan Bedford: It's way bigger. It's more detailed, probably not necessarily bigger, but detailed.

11
00:01:02,251 --> 00:01:05,532
Andrew Bailey: Should we start with the original one and then look at Sam's and try to map them. 

12
00:01:05,652 --> 00:01:07,172
Jake Herwaldt: The more exhausted one's better, right. 

13
00:01:07,211 --> 00:01:28,521
Nathan Bedford: My feeling was it would take a bit less time just if we're looking at the time savings. I think what she did was just a superset of what she... She added more detail to them, but nothing is brand new, I don't think. Jake, when you look at this earlier, so she's got it grouped into must-haves, should-haves, could-haves. And then will-not-haves. And her will-not-haves is just my way of saying must-haves in the opposite direction, really.

14
00:01:28,902 --> 00:01:29,582
Jake Herwaldt: Must-not-haves.

15
00:01:29,582 --> 00:01:31,582
Nathan Bedford: Yeah, so, okay.

16
00:01:32,832 --> 00:01:33,551
Jake Herwaldt: What's your question, though. 

17
00:01:33,912 --> 00:01:42,292
Nathan Bedford: Yeah, so could-haves, I can give you, those are less. I guess I'll start with those, because I think we can rule those out as a not-a-phase-one thing. Okay, okay.

18
00:01:42,491 --> 00:01:44,632
Jake Herwaldt: Are you marking them in some way? Okay, okay.

19
00:01:47,252 --> 00:02:05,204
Nathan Bedford: We'll have to spend half a day organizing our data, obviously. But this is just, I'll take what was given in the scope. This is really, I'll just put phase. So the could-not, the... The could-haves. Oh, you're not in the site.

20
00:02:05,204 --> 00:02:06,863
Jake Herwaldt: I was going to follow you in Sheets.

21
00:02:06,904 --> 00:02:23,084
Nathan Bedford: Yeah, I pulled this down to import it. That's fine. Do you. OK, so ability for vendors to explicit could-haves. Ability for vendors to export and use data from portals. That actually feels like a newer thing to me. That's not phase one, we agree. Nothing we've heard makes us think that vendors need to do.

22
00:02:23,404 --> 00:02:23,763
Andrew Bailey: Yeah.

23
00:02:24,024 --> 00:02:35,094
Nathan Bedford: I'll just say two plus. Ability for internal block teams to propose new suppliers. Definitely base two plus. Ability, I mean, I'm going to, you guys tell me if I'm wrong. I'm going to make my side up.

24
00:02:35,094 --> 00:02:37,934
Jake Herwaldt: What's the persona we're on right now? This is SW or SWP.

25
00:02:39,084 --> 00:03:09,406
Nathan Bedford: So procurement, so the buyers. Ability for vendors to upload view of their terms and conditions. That was already listed as not a phase one. OK. That had been in earlier. So I think all these are pretty clearly not phase one, not in B plus. I mean, I do think. Because we can confirm these things, but we're . Yeah, we will. Yeah, you're right. This is for us to confirm . I don't believe these are not based on. Ability for vendors to view their approval status in SW, not current state, therefore not based. And it's not, what's been listed is MBD plus.

26
00:03:10,126 --> 00:03:22,966
Nathan Bedford: So that's the could haves. I'm gonna switch to the could haves. I'm sorry, that wasn't, I mean, the tab coloration on this Excel file is horrible. I can't tell the difference. That was not at the SWP, that was at the SWP, SW. So that was buyers.

27
00:03:22,966 --> 00:03:24,266
Jake Herwaldt: SW, so that was vendors.

28
00:03:24,586 --> 00:03:35,586
Nathan Bedford: Yeah. SWP is for buyers. Vendors, yes, vendors. Now I'm switching to buyers. That made sense why I was saying vendors everywhere. So now on the buyer side, the ability for an account to have multiple profiles. See, I think that actually needs to be probably.

29
00:03:35,906 --> 00:03:36,806
Jake Herwaldt: We need to talk about that.

30
00:03:36,886 --> 00:03:38,426
Nathan Bedford: Yeah, that's the vindication, which I think.

31
00:03:38,526 --> 00:03:40,046
Jake Herwaldt: Can you just say define or something. 

32
00:03:40,406 --> 00:03:40,646
Nathan Bedford: Yeah, I will.

33
00:03:41,336 --> 00:03:42,996
Jake Herwaldt: That feels like that should be the first one.

34
00:03:43,136 --> 00:03:45,116
Nathan Bedford: Yeah, that was exactly what I was missing.

35
00:03:45,276 --> 00:03:52,516
Andrew Bailey: Yes and no. I can't imagine us deciding to build it. Like, I'm not worried about it. We'll just push something else out if it's big.

36
00:03:52,636 --> 00:04:05,550
Nathan Bedford: Oh, here's what it actually means, this is helpful. Here's what they meant, they have a detail column. We have customers who want to be in SWP, but currently have existing SW. accounts it cannot currently be enrolled oh that's awesome yeah yeah so well what does.

37
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:09,690
Jake Herwaldt: that look like does that does that look like that's how we do anyways does that look like.

38
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:16,550
Nathan Bedford: us having two different domains it's roles no in fact they said they clearly there's no need for two domains which is what they have right now so they're going from two domains to one.

39
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:26,830
Jake Herwaldt: so then how do you know what i am right now it's just what you're just talking about right now no no i log in i think i'm like i want to be a buyer i think you have to work through that workflow.

40
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:56,360
Nathan Bedford: flow to understand what does that look like because yeah that's i've seen this kind of be a role switching problem or do you just this is just different pages and different views and you know i don't know like it's significantly different it might be a yeah because flash let's give a real quick example of where you're playing different roles, i'm sure that people other people are like block who are both sourcing parts and buying parts, well we've done it before yeah this is like blanco teacher at the teacher being a student they had the same problem and they didn't solve this um.

41
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:18,022
Nathan Bedford: in in lincoln you've got tas who are teaching students, but are also taking higher ed classes. Okay. Interactive help features, chat bots, this is too vague, so we shouldn't talk about it. Also, there can, yeah, anyway. Their note on that was, if they get stuck currently, they don't have immediate info on who to contact, what to do.

42
00:05:18,082 --> 00:05:19,001
Jake Herwaldt: Phase two and phase three.

43
00:05:19,342 --> 00:05:20,282
Nathan Bedford: That's where that might be.

44
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:22,662
Jake Herwaldt: But that's just literally tool tips and tools.

45
00:05:22,662 --> 00:05:30,121
Nathan Bedford: That's my question, actually. What's phase one versus two and three? Phase one might just be, you need help, click this button, here's a help page that has all the help information.

46
00:05:30,522 --> 00:05:36,602
Jake Herwaldt: Do you want to have a delimiter in there, a delimiter in there that's like a minimal phase one, but then expands in phase two, three. 

47
00:05:36,741 --> 00:05:41,562
Andrew Bailey: Yeah, I think. I think if you do one comma two, it'll be like, all right, let's talk about this display.

48
00:05:42,262 --> 00:05:55,551
Nathan Bedford: Okay, yeah, and I think even to your point, that might be two, three, and four, which I'll get into now. But to your point, though, it could be a tool tips, like a guided tour. Something has to be there.

49
00:05:55,572 --> 00:05:57,472
Andrew Bailey: Something will be phase one, and something will like.

50
00:05:58,522 --> 00:06:05,903
Nathan Bedford: Ability for customers to be exposed. of Davidson Portal, that's, again, that feels like that's not a thing, but I think when.

51
00:06:05,903 --> 00:06:09,443
Jake Herwaldt: we say it that way, unless it's already in there, but I don't think it is, and that's.

52
00:06:09,443 --> 00:06:12,183
Nathan Bedford: why if it's could-haves, like could-haves, if you look at the menu, this is definitely.

53
00:06:12,183 --> 00:06:16,433
Jake Herwaldt: the, not the main one, oh, I forgot that's the lens we're looking at, or these are still.

54
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:49,643
Nathan Bedford: the lens, yeah, sorry, sorry, in fact, that's interesting about even if you want to be already suggested, customers should have the ability to chat on the order record in addition to the SRC record, you should, but should have, and it could have, yeah, yeah, I'm used to talking about that, um, yeah, I think they can already do that, um, can't they, like I thought they can, they can, they're just separate, yes, that's right, and there's no like messages page or something, right, it just says, oh, I should just search all of the messages, yeah, I think we need a little more clarity on that one, but I think we know what they mean, um, okay, this is what they, the description, we don't love this feature.

55
00:06:49,643 --> 00:07:14,575
Nathan Bedford: currently, and we'll be interested in seeing the ultimate alternative, okay, yeah, that's fine, we'll figure it out, that feels like a beyond, well, we'll see, customers, if that's what they want, the plus, that's fine, customers could have, If you have the ability to export views from SOP into Excel, just export, that's like a super simple export. If that's really all that it is, that might be easy for us to, you know what I mean. 

56
00:07:14,655 --> 00:07:32,095
Andrew Bailey: Yes, I do. Almost every app we've built that has the list in Excel. There's one thing that, there's another thing that Al Alonzo is super good at is saying, I want you to hit the export button. Yeah, we built that like four or five times a day, right? Literally. Yeah. Sometimes it just doesn't, when I say mention something remotely, it's like, hey, I built this like four or five times a day.

57
00:07:32,215 --> 00:07:36,475
Nathan Bedford: Yeah. Customers could have further prompts training on how to filter through the.

58
00:07:37,605 --> 00:07:39,025
Jake Herwaldt: It's more tool-tippy stuff.

59
00:07:40,165 --> 00:07:44,655
Nathan Bedford: Yes. Currently they can't filter, but it's not. I'm thinking that's big.

60
00:07:44,695 --> 00:07:48,235
Jake Herwaldt: That's just improved UX, which might come for free.

61
00:07:49,626 --> 00:07:58,945
Andrew Bailey: I'll get a refresher. I would just like to . You need to stop hanging around with Bates so much. We brought you on here for cold blooded. You got it.

62
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:06,939
Nathan Bedford: This is how we don't share all these transcriptions that we're putting in. Yeah, yeah, thanks. Okay, so this is just.

63
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:07,979
Jake Herwaldt: Fresh, now frozen.

64
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:16,519
Nathan Bedford: This is literally just, can the page automatically refresh its data every one, two, five minutes? Yes, yes, yes. Sure. Move on. How about we do it, how about we do it instantaneously. 

65
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:20,339
Andrew Bailey: Yeah, can we make that a bare bones thing? Cause I just.

66
00:08:20,359 --> 00:08:21,599
Jake Herwaldt: No, guys, guys.

67
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:22,599
Andrew Bailey: Sales 101.

68
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:29,399
Jake Herwaldt: You show up and there is a refresh button. And then they're like, can it be instantaneous. 

69
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:48,609
Nathan Bedford: Wait a minute, do you want one, two, or three minutes or all three? Is that the premium feature? I just want to build a system that's just like, sorry. Let's put it this way, the merge ordering system that I built has this. So we'll probably leave it.

70
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:59,300
Andrew Bailey: Right, that was a fun, unexpected win. That would be really funny to be able to say, we did it in our merge system, we're not sure what to do in here, unless you guys. We still don't have enough time, it's hard.

71
00:09:00,031 --> 00:09:03,352
Jake Herwaldt: Okay, this is going to take forever to get through on your video list.

72
00:09:04,191 --> 00:09:11,242
Nathan Bedford: So now we're on, that's all the good news. We'll not have any connection, I think that's just fine. That's an obvious one.

73
00:09:11,421 --> 00:09:11,742
Jake Herwaldt: That's fine.

74
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:24,031
Nathan Bedford: And then we'll not have for the other side of the, it was the same kind of thing, we'll not have the ability, oh, sorry, we'll not have any connection. Do you really want to get that out there? Don't worry, no connection to Legendary at all.

75
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:25,291
Jake Herwaldt: Say we hate Legendary too.

76
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:43,622
Nathan Bedford: And I think what I'm hearing is Legendary is both a product, I think it's what they're calling the product, and it's the company behind it. It's like, that's why it was confusing. Okay, then this is where Sam told me, I asked her at lunch, she's like, well, I'm going to need more heat on later, because it was confusing a little. On SRC, did you hear, over here talking about this, on the SRC record.

77
00:09:44,262 --> 00:09:45,581
Jake Herwaldt: What category are we in, sorry. 

78
00:09:45,622 --> 00:09:46,681
Nathan Bedford: This is back to.

79
00:09:46,722 --> 00:09:47,521
Jake Herwaldt: To should or don't.

80
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,061
Nathan Bedford: This is now will not have.

81
00:09:50,161 --> 00:09:50,722
Jake Herwaldt: Will not have.

82
00:09:50,722 --> 00:09:54,982
Nathan Bedford: Which is really another way of saying. Or SW. Must not have. Yeah, this is back to SW.

83
00:09:55,222 --> 00:09:55,841
Jake Herwaldt: Okay, okay.

84
00:09:56,061 --> 00:10:09,603
Nathan Bedford: On the, when you're on the sourcing record. Okay. There shouldn't be an edit. You shouldn't be able to go change the status, only the way the status changes when you're moving through the workflow. Sure. Obviously. There shouldn't be a cancel or save button because they do different things you wouldn't expect.

85
00:10:09,764 --> 00:10:11,343
Jake Herwaldt: She was saying... Yes. Yeah.

86
00:10:11,964 --> 00:10:12,343
Nathan Bedford: That's fine.

87
00:10:12,524 --> 00:10:13,524
Jake Herwaldt: Yes, I did hear that.

88
00:10:13,764 --> 00:10:15,584
Nathan Bedford: Yeah. She said if you hit cancel, it refreshes the page.

89
00:10:16,384 --> 00:10:22,584
Jake Herwaldt: Cancel, refreshes, save doesn't do anything. The way to save is to close the next button. So she's saying don't do that.

90
00:10:22,824 --> 00:10:28,983
Nathan Bedford: I got it. Check, check, check. Okay. So cool. Now we're down to the bigger lists, which are the should haves and the...

91
00:10:28,983 --> 00:10:38,064
Jake Herwaldt: Because I think she was saying some of that stuff because she genuinely... She said out loud, when we say we want you to replace the current system, I don't want you to literally replace the current system.

92
00:10:38,064 --> 00:10:56,973
Nathan Bedford: And I think she's used to having to spell this out for all the vendors. And that's what we had said is, that's when you asked, can we just reimagine? That's right. Andy was talking to Ziggy. But what we asked was, what Jake asked was, can we just reimagine stuff? You tell us the work you're trying to do, the problem you're trying to solve. We walk you through our... Yeah.

93
00:10:57,093 --> 00:11:03,716
Jake Herwaldt: Do you want me to improve your current process? Right. or do you want me to re-imagine? She was like, re-imagine. Yeah, yeah. She's totally down for that.

94
00:11:03,816 --> 00:11:04,796
Nathan Bedford: So a lot of this goes away. Okay.

95
00:11:05,216 --> 00:11:09,246
Jake Herwaldt: I also wonder how often we'll see her now. Which one? She's consulting, Sam.

96
00:11:10,466 --> 00:11:14,146
Nathan Bedford: She's staying in a couple months. I think she's consulting specifically for this equipment.

97
00:11:14,386 --> 00:11:16,106
Jake Herwaldt: Right. I just didn't know, like, yeah.

98
00:11:16,566 --> 00:11:38,576
Nathan Bedford: She's not an actual consultant. She's just part-time here. Yeah, yeah. That's it. Okay. So now we're looking at SW, not SWP, is the must-haves. Ability to fully manage suppliers while still agnostic to block. Detail context. Assigning vendor capabilities. Okay. Tracking DOA rates, et cetera, for blocking.

99
00:11:40,676 --> 00:11:42,196
Jake Herwaldt: I feel like that's not phase one.

100
00:11:42,996 --> 00:12:02,420
Nathan Bedford: New functionality, yes and no. Current system, resistant blocks, we can integrate into the system. That's, like, the very first must-have that she has. Oh, that's a must-have. Yeah, these are must-haves. Okay. So then she kind of mixed things. Like, obviously being able to assign vendor capabilities is critical. Tracking DOA rates, I think that's... That's a new feature. Maybe we have some more.

101
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,240
Jake Herwaldt: Yeah, question mark.

102
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,240
Nathan Bedford: It feels like there's going to be how much debt do you want? There's a couple things wrapped up in that.

103
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:06,680
Jake Herwaldt: One, two.

104
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:16,530
Andrew Bailey: What if we name this MedPartsPlus, but then have a basic and a super name? So MedPartsPlusSuperClean.

105
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:44,800
Nathan Bedford: That makes a lot of sense. Let's do that. You get to do the marketing for that. Now we have sourcing. It's not in the bucket now. Still must have sourcing and vendor management ability for vendors to have multiple. Yeah, that was just covered above. These are buckets that we put them into to route requests to. I think that's Facebook. That's just basic. Must be able to rank each vendor with new capability within tier, so that's really just put them into tier.

106
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,880
Jake Herwaldt: That is new, though, huh. 

107
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:55,060
Nathan Bedford: No, they did that right now. It's not new. Really? Yeah, they currently put them in tier, so they auto source. This is admin, block admin stuff.

108
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,140
Jake Herwaldt: Oh, we're in block admin.

109
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,740
Nathan Bedford: Well, this is not called block admin.

110
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,240
Jake Herwaldt: Yeah, because that's weird. OK. That's fine.

111
00:12:59,360 --> 00:12:59,900
Nathan Bedford: That's a fair question.

112
00:13:00,032 --> 00:13:01,512
Jake Herwaldt: Because SWP doesn't do that.

113
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:03,942
Nathan Bedford: This is not SWP right now.

114
00:13:03,982 --> 00:13:07,022
Jake Herwaldt: This is SW? Yeah. Oh, okay. But still, anyway, okay.

115
00:13:07,222 --> 00:13:07,942
Nathan Bedford: Yeah, but that's a good question.

116
00:13:07,942 --> 00:13:08,922
Jake Herwaldt: That's an internal thing.

117
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:10,562
Nathan Bedford: This is where it gets a little bit too...

118
00:13:11,212 --> 00:13:12,472
Jake Herwaldt: So I would say that's phase two.

119
00:13:13,412 --> 00:13:31,212
Nathan Bedford: This is where we probably need to define what workflows, what work needs to happen in the new system versus just whatever happens in Salesforce gets closed. I don't know. Yeah. Let me see if she says... These are buckets. We put them in to wrap the question. That is a good question about...

120
00:13:31,212 --> 00:13:37,912
Jake Herwaldt: I just feel like if our focus is external vendor, internal buyer, anything not that is out of scope.

121
00:13:38,112 --> 00:13:39,252
Nathan Bedford: I'm going to say at phase two...

122
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:41,052
Jake Herwaldt: Unless it's fundamental to the database.

123
00:13:41,702 --> 00:13:42,022
Nathan Bedford: Yeah.

124
00:13:42,042 --> 00:13:44,682
Jake Herwaldt: But, I mean, you could add a field later. That's that.

125
00:13:45,222 --> 00:14:16,554
Nathan Bedford: And they might... Yeah, they might... That one in particular is an admin thing. As far as I know, at least, there's no tiers that are happening outside of the block ad. You must be able to manage customer concession vendors. I don't know what that means. If not approved or actively listed as customer concession by block, teams just need to have this building. Oh, I think I remember. Customer concession is like, we really shouldn't use them. I remember this from our videos. It's like, the only time we're going to use them is if, like, fine, I guess we have to.

126
00:14:16,554 --> 00:14:19,914
Jake Herwaldt: Oh, the worst year. Yeah, so then we're still on this internal. Okay.

127
00:14:19,974 --> 00:14:34,384
Nathan Bedford: Yeah. Teams have, okay, I think you still asked about it. I'm putting that as phase two sync and Salesforce question mark. It sounds like phase two. It must be able to record vendor warehouse locations and shipping cutoff times on vendor accounts.

128
00:14:34,384 --> 00:14:38,244
Jake Herwaldt: This is all internal stuff. Can you mark this with, as, like, internal. 

129
00:14:38,784 --> 00:14:39,264
Nathan Bedford: Yeah.

130
00:14:39,424 --> 00:14:40,444
Jake Herwaldt: An internal flag. 

131
00:14:40,804 --> 00:14:41,284
Speaker 4: Um.

132
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:23,856
Nathan Bedford: Okay, must be this is all under the sourcing and vendor management section of the community as well. We'll see if there's two more like this. Must be able to record vendor warehouse locations, various of that. Yeah, that sounds like internal. On capability record, we must be able to include notes visibility visible to internal block users. Okay, that whole section just sounds like we need to find out what's going on.

133
00:15:25,806 --> 00:15:43,416
Andrew Bailey: Well, and that's that's a good question. Her saying that is not the same as Paul Beard's, right? We want this to be a product and what she's essentially saying is there is the sales, sourcing window admin person who can see capability notes, and then there's the internal team can see capability notes.

134
00:15:44,886 --> 00:15:52,856
Nathan Bedford: Yeah, that's right. This might be for phase one just a synchronization. So if notes exist in Salesforce, we can see them, somebody can see them on the inside as well.

135
00:15:52,896 --> 00:15:58,376
Andrew Bailey: But if I'm a customer and I have a vendor relationship, I would want to see our capability notes on them.

136
00:15:58,936 --> 00:16:19,070
Nathan Bedford: Yeah. Ability for vendors to be connected to multiple customers. That's just connected flags. I think that's phase one. User must be able to have multiple users under one account. And I think the way they're calling an account is an account like a Salesforce account. So we could say organization, by the way.

137
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:19,790
Speaker 4: Yeah, yeah.

138
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:28,410
Nathan Bedford: Okay, homepage. Users must be able to see who is logged in from the homepage.

139
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,650
Jake Herwaldt: Yeah, like their name in the corner, like the avatar.

140
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:37,170
Speaker 4: Okay, that's really... No, I know. Come on, move on. I know, I know.

141
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:39,410
Nathan Bedford: That's what that means. I wouldn't guess that.

142
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,590
Andrew Bailey: They need to be able to see how many minutes they've been on.

143
00:16:41,990 --> 00:17:07,932
Nathan Bedford: Okay, this is a good example of envisioning versus... If they see homepage must default to open requests, we probably would say we'll get a new dashboard that shows you, you know, things you want to see. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Requests must be ordered... Speak a little deeper. Requests must be ordered... Oh, that's a question now. SRCs must display with time... Open SRC number, I'm gonna just skip through that. That's obviously like all of these are super detailed on the home page. They're either user experience stuff and I don't know any detail.

144
00:17:08,232 --> 00:17:10,392
Jake Herwaldt: I think it's literally her describing the current system.

145
00:17:10,392 --> 00:17:22,542
Nathan Bedford: Yeah, I think you're right. I wouldn't call, yeah. When responding from, we'll use these to build the cards. Yeah. Okay, when responding from the home page, do you use them to be able to press an enable button without drilling into SRC? That's the, that is the...

146
00:17:23,612 --> 00:17:31,372
Jake Herwaldt: How about we also do it in the email? For real though, can you put maybe like insert a row? Yeah, yeah. Cause like that's us adding scope, but not ridiculous.

147
00:17:31,692 --> 00:17:54,232
Nathan Bedford: I think as far as the email goes, we'll just have to make sure we figure out what that looks like from a compliance perspective. Cause that would either mean, the question I would wonder is, actually I'm not sure. Store the login in the cookie cookie. Where else can we store it, Jake? No, it's a matter of like, they should mention not having to log in to do that, but I think what she meant. Is just if you're already logged in. 

148
00:17:54,252 --> 00:17:55,132
Jake Herwaldt: don't make them log in again.

149
00:17:55,212 --> 00:17:56,952
Nathan Bedford: Right, yes. Cause there is ways to make it.

150
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:59,652
Andrew Bailey: If they click it on mobile. Cause we can make, cause the session is still live.

151
00:18:00,064 --> 00:18:07,184
Nathan Bedford: Yeah, right, and there's ways you could make it truly like an unauthenticated experience, but I don't think you need that. No, no, no. Like, there's times when you need to do that.

152
00:18:07,424 --> 00:18:12,944
Andrew Bailey: I don't know, I've never had to invent something. I know it can be done, because I've touched it and done it.

153
00:18:13,464 --> 00:18:35,984
Nathan Bedford: Yeah, I've seen it frequently in orders and I've ordered stuff. How many times has he ordered a mattress? It's been in a cup recently, and then twice in the last five years. I mean, isn't it just a URL with an ID in it, and then when... And then you'd have to have some back-end, like, one-time usage things. The problem with that is you can't tell who it was. Yeah, there's different rules of whether or not you're using it.

154
00:18:36,104 --> 00:18:37,864
Jake Herwaldt: Yeah, we auth it. We would not auth it.

155
00:18:37,904 --> 00:18:45,044
Nathan Bedford: No, well, she said specifically, they don't have to be logged into this, but I'm realizing what she meant was they don't have to be explicitly logged in separately.

156
00:18:45,664 --> 00:18:50,264
Andrew Bailey: We'd have to ask that question. Are you willing to let somebody else who's not with that email come forward. 

157
00:18:50,264 --> 00:19:00,044
Jake Herwaldt: Yeah, forwarded that email, and they can confirm it. I would say no, I would say no. We want to track it. And when she says not logged in, I think... I think she meant we're previously logged in.

158
00:19:00,096 --> 00:19:11,856
Andrew Bailey: And that also scares me because if you're sending out, I mean, it's probably really hard, but that's an open endpoint. Yeah, right, right. Even if though even if it is a wonky. Yeah. Yeah, I think it's helpful to this is kind of like.

159
00:19:11,856 --> 00:19:42,306
Nathan Bedford: You should have your name Like oh, I would never have said that way, but I think I see what you meant Yeah, okay home page view must be able to so from home page view vendors must be able to view their connected customers They must be able to see either three ones see the roll-up of pending fulfillments Those little dashboard icons on top to see the number right must be they call them roll-ups to be able to see pending fulfillments, Request history that one's doubled up in order histories. These are all just show very simple metrics on the dashboard It was search each list you open.

160
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:59,716
Nathan Bedford: I mean, yeah, yes pending the film. It's gotta must it's gonna be shorter to do it than it will be to read it I did that's kind of a writer. I mean, you know must The pennies on the tab must display, You don't have to.

161
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,920
Andrew Bailey: You can read through them if you want.

162
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:19,570
Nathan Bedford: I'm scanning through it to see if it's even worth discussing. This one is a little bit longer. This is worth reading through. I had to actually scroll to see. Okay, so the ending fulfillment tab should display obvious information that we put in the card. But then there's age open, which is a specific time measure. It was created. Confirmed button to click in to view.

163
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:24,390
Andrew Bailey: Okay, active. And what we need to do is it needs to be an unformatted black or red minutes.

164
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:56,950
Nathan Bedford: Yes, that's what they need. Just like we saw? Yeah. Okay, request history view. I mean, just this too. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. That's just really basic stuff. So this is really talking about us all describing the homepage. What we would say to dashboard. Responding to SRC. Okay. Then it must be able to see SRC. This does kind of suck. And we'll have to bake and malt internationalization, which Emily, I don't know if she has it here,

165
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,170
Nathan Bedford: but she already mentioned it.

166
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:05,631
Andrew Bailey: I'm already like realizing. Okay. Somebody could make a request in California. I mean, obviously, they're going to do it all in WGC, but...

167
00:21:05,952 --> 00:21:31,651
Nathan Bedford: Yeah, it's a large place where things go wrong, yeah. Okay, so a vendor must be able to see... When a vendor's responding to the SRC, they can see basic information that we would... They should be able to respond from the email by logging into the portal. We should find out what exactly... Oh, she said, for example, Virtus Imaging. That's the one we're saying. We just need to know what you mean by that. But if you mean there's a difference between... There's a significant difference between buttons or hit reply, you know. 

168
00:21:31,772 --> 00:21:32,851
Jake Herwaldt: Mm-hmm, yeah.

169
00:21:33,111 --> 00:21:35,591
Nathan Bedford: Both of which you can... You can do one as much as you can do the other.

170
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:38,752
Jake Herwaldt: What ID are you on? I just want to follow along.

171
00:21:38,932 --> 00:21:50,202
Nathan Bedford: Me? Oh, um... 21. Oh, yeah. No, I'm with you. I just wanted to be with you. Row 25. Yeah, vendors must be able to respond. Okay, we got that. So that's the first...

172
00:21:50,202 --> 00:21:51,141
Jake Herwaldt: Oh, that's the one. Okay.

173
00:21:51,282 --> 00:21:58,802
Nathan Bedford: That is the one right there. We just need to know... We need to describe to her what we think she said and just say the answer. Then no stop button. That's really important.

174
00:22:01,883 --> 00:22:05,083
Jake Herwaldt: But it makes sense, time is money, they just want it to be done.

175
00:22:05,323 --> 00:22:39,163
Nathan Bedford: Totally. It is a real pain point that is not hard to do. This system should automatically update and status the time, close the record off, keep the vendor on the page. Buttons at the bottom of SRC, there should be a submit quote, clone, no stock. I would say that's too detailed. We don't know if that should be at the bottom or somewhere else. We tell you where it should be and you tell us if you love it or hate it. The ability, really, is what she means, to submit it, clone it, no stock. To submit quote, minimize the required pieces, send exchange outright, condition warranty.

176
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:55,274
Nathan Bedford: WANV field should default to WANV or name check, they're completely available. New checkbox, this item is on the backboard. That's a good example of, I can add the checkbox, how does that get synchronized to whatever is behind it.

177
00:22:55,433 --> 00:23:04,655
Jake Herwaldt: Yeah, that's a couple of the, like a lot of this, I'm more concerned truly of, like the FMD element of it, you know what I mean. 

178
00:23:05,235 --> 00:23:05,935
Nathan Bedford: Yes, exactly.

179
00:23:06,115 --> 00:23:08,275
Jake Herwaldt: Like, cool, we have it, but then now what. 

180
00:23:08,515 --> 00:23:33,275
Nathan Bedford: Yep, okay, and then her note on that is, if vendor selects this, it must be visible to customer and has to be block imaging as it means . Yeah, you're right, that's the data behind the question. All right, we're halfway through this list, more than halfway through, I'm on that side, okay. If vendor submits quote, it keeps them on the record with a submitted notification and allows them to clone it for the second time with it, so it's just workbook.

181
00:23:33,275 --> 00:23:39,085
Jake Herwaldt: But that's where you pointed out of like, does cloning make sense, or can I just add an option within there. 

182
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:46,726
Nathan Bedford: I love it, as you said, as developers, it's their note, please propose an alternative way of users offering multiple options for one material. That's what I was asking yesterday.

183
00:23:46,885 --> 00:24:08,799
Jake Herwaldt: Yep, yep, yep, multiple options. Basically being like, instead of, right now, what they do is they clone quotes, instead of just saying, I have this new, I have this refurbished, I have this this. Basically, to me, it. It's just like a field with that always has one and then it's like add new row is always showing to be like I have another option or add a new condition.

184
00:24:08,939 --> 00:24:27,749
Nathan Bedford: This is where I think you running with UX will be fun to see that because we know that they're really interested in workflow improvements. I'm really curious how many of whoever's doing this, likes keyboard navigation versus not. Like I don't wanna, I think it was actually for the mouse. But like we wanna make the tabs really simple. The arrow keys do what you expect.

185
00:24:28,029 --> 00:24:28,409
Andrew Bailey: Yeah.

186
00:24:28,469 --> 00:24:29,689
Nathan Bedford: Enter key does what you expect.

187
00:24:29,689 --> 00:24:40,979
Andrew Bailey: Yeah, I mean, honestly, A plus, A software does that and A plus is such a stretch. Like it's such a minimum bar to be A, A minus. Yeah. And then to be superhuman, very few.

188
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:50,729
Nathan Bedford: Oh yeah, superhuman really is the top. Okay, so now we're on the vendor must be able to view all connected clone option history. I think that means all connected clone options.

189
00:24:51,069 --> 00:25:01,331
Jake Herwaldt: Basically if I cloned, cause currently I cloned and this is now multiple things. I wanna be able to see that I did that. We would just. probably group it as one thing.

190
00:25:01,511 --> 00:25:02,591
Nathan Bedford: Yeah, I think I'm really curious what.

191
00:25:02,731 --> 00:25:06,591
Jake Herwaldt: It's one quote in my head. It's just multiple options within the quote.

192
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:15,071
Nathan Bedford: Just change the way, it might be a thing you expand and use as well. Then we have, must be able to view, you vendor must be able to view customers.

193
00:25:15,311 --> 00:25:20,291
Jake Herwaldt: It's like they're in Excel right now and they're like, everything has to be a row. And we're like, well, what the heck.

194
00:25:21,781 --> 00:25:34,981
Nathan Bedford: This is the one about being able to have the conversation. Like this is a good example where, we have so many tiny points. This one is a lot baked into it, which is that they must be able to have a conversation, and send messages and files, et cetera.

195
00:25:35,141 --> 00:25:35,461
Jake Herwaldt: Yes.

196
00:25:36,181 --> 00:25:38,201
Nathan Bedford: That one is worth its own little digging into.

197
00:25:38,441 --> 00:25:43,861
Jake Herwaldt: I had a full flow diagram we didn't talk about. That's communication. That I don't know if we need to, but.

198
00:25:44,401 --> 00:25:49,281
Nathan Bedford: We can tell that was the one that they listed as a major pain point is the messaging, communication side of things.

199
00:25:49,341 --> 00:26:02,533
Jake Herwaldt: And they said it needs to be like if, ooh, that would be a good question for us to ask them next one. Andy, this sounds like a thing you would do is be like, hey, if you can choose one feature, to be amazing. What's the future. 

200
00:26:03,153 --> 00:26:13,453
Nathan Bedford: What's the second future that you're like? Like what's the thing you really want to make amazing? They started leaning into FSC mobile way more than I expected, and I feel like we led that. And then they ran with it.

201
00:26:14,153 --> 00:26:20,333
Jake Herwaldt: Because I think just the pain point, you don't have a solution. We're not replacing a current solution, we're creating a solution.

202
00:26:20,593 --> 00:26:29,253
Nathan Bedford: And what we saw, Vicky and Ellie going over at the end was really helpful, that I'm realizing that we are, we have the benefit of being outside the system to see, obviously it should be one system, guys.

203
00:26:29,413 --> 00:26:29,633
Jake Herwaldt: Yeah.

204
00:26:29,753 --> 00:26:35,953
Nathan Bedford: And they're so like, even Steve's on the ramp up with, maybe we shouldn't keep it inside of Salesforce.

205
00:26:36,273 --> 00:26:36,613
Jake Herwaldt: Yeah.

206
00:26:36,733 --> 00:26:38,013
Nathan Bedford: If that was good for me to see. 

207
00:26:38,393 --> 00:26:43,973
Jake Herwaldt: they, yeah, cause he's been saying, that's not a scope, guys, you don't have to worry about that. Until now, he's like, well, maybe.

208
00:26:44,133 --> 00:27:13,645
Nathan Bedford: I think it's starting to shift, yeah, okay. So then we got 31, processing orders, vendor must be able to click into order from pending fulfillment view and from link in email. Sure, so we'll be able to open it. See this view as a customer, vendor must be able to see this view as a customer. Vendor must be able to see this view as a customer. to see that the same view as customer here, that's like a concern. So you recap the purchase fields, customer name, POs, your date of strong use, the vendor must be able to click to confirm the order, what does that mean. 

209
00:27:13,745 --> 00:27:18,745
Jake Herwaldt: That means the customer's going to want it, and the vendor's going to say, The vendor must be able to click confirm, yeah, that means yes.

210
00:27:19,085 --> 00:27:25,965
Nathan Bedford: So is this the workflow? I didn't pay, I didn't follow this all the way. So like, the buyer's like, I want these things, I'm going to hit up all these vendors, vendors are like, cool, here's what we can offer.

211
00:27:25,965 --> 00:27:26,585
Jake Herwaldt: Vendor's like, yes.

212
00:27:26,865 --> 00:27:29,985
Nathan Bedford: And the buyer's like, good, I want this. The vendor's like, cool, I'll confirm it.

213
00:27:29,985 --> 00:27:32,605
Jake Herwaldt: Yes, and then vendor finally adds tracking.

214
00:27:34,005 --> 00:27:41,905
Nathan Bedford: Launches, email notifications, customer, period, and product, and it stops the timer. Oh yeah, so that's those, obviously the details on exactly what the timers are doing, what we're doing.

215
00:27:41,905 --> 00:28:17,669
Jake Herwaldt: I think there's multiple timers here, too. Because there's like, my time to get confirmed that I ordered, like, as a vendor, I, because one timer, right, should be like my response time between things. Another timer should be, I guess it's not even a timer, we're just going to have timestamps on everything. But, But basically another one, Nate, is like the idea of going from vendor or buyer reach out to you to vendor finally said, yes, I will fulfill it versus I shipped it. Like that's different because I would want to know that stat of like how long from when you say, yes, I have it to shipping it.

216
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:27,229
Andrew Bailey: Yeah, because that will be different numbers. Some people will emphasize they'll gain it. You know, if it's gamified, they'll gamify it. They'll respond quickly to something because they would rather deal with it.

217
00:28:27,229 --> 00:28:29,749
Jake Herwaldt: But they'd suck at shipping it because their shipping department sucks.

218
00:28:30,349 --> 00:28:31,509
Andrew Bailey: Or, yeah, whatever.

219
00:28:32,989 --> 00:28:38,299
Nathan Bedford: Good. So I'm just going to do the other one. Yeah, I'm going to do the other one. Chatter messages. I hate that name.

220
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:41,179
Jake Herwaldt: Their fancy email is garbage.

221
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:47,519
Nathan Bedford: What's that about? What's chatter? What's the chatter? The chatter bothers me. It kind of bothers me in that first sort of tune out.

222
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:48,999
Speaker 4: No, I love it.

223
00:28:49,099 --> 00:28:57,119
Nathan Bedford: Once a sourcing record has been purchased, the vendor may still use EMA on that record, but it's guided to the PO record if messages are related to it or so.

224
00:28:57,399 --> 00:28:58,839
Jake Herwaldt: EMA is their messaging system.

225
00:28:59,219 --> 00:28:59,699
Nathan Bedford: That's chatter.

226
00:29:00,971 --> 00:29:31,081
Jake Herwaldt: No, it's not. It's their own. Well, I asked that question. Oh, you did. Yeah. In fact, they even say it right now. Okay. I mean, I want to. Because EMA is their messaging for this system, but it might be chatter behind the scenes. It is chatter behind the scenes. It's Salesforce chatter behind the scenes. It certainly seems like it. It seems like that's an app. I guess everything's, everything's Salesforce, right? Yeah, I was thinking about that. Nothing's not. I think they have the capability to do this. Especially, it had app features in it, and I just don't think. Did you hear FMD pulled their. Yeah, I did. They pulled their.

227
00:29:31,201 --> 00:30:03,253
Nathan Bedford: submission from this project. Were you hearing about that? No, no, no. He was talking to me. Yeah, that was a really, like, I'm starting to see, there might have, I'm curious how much that would change our bid. Basically, FMD, this is Steve saying that they were, Steve's name? No, Paul. They realized they were going to overextend it if they took this, so they really wanted it, but they decided. They pulled it out. They pulled it out. I asked, were they really, like, generally, I was trying to say, were they capable of doing this? Because they're such a Salesforce. and they think really highly of Jeff.

228
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:03,993
Nathan Bedford: Jeff.

229
00:30:04,453 --> 00:30:07,873
Jake Herwaldt: I've heard Paul feel like he's very connected with them.

230
00:30:07,993 --> 00:30:28,033
Nathan Bedford: Paul, yeah. I think Paul has a real connection to them. But Steve is like super, still highly viewing Jeff, who's their director. And I looked at his LinkedIn, he talks all the way I talk, honestly, about like the things that motivate him. I hope we connect well. But that helped me realize, oh, I wonder if that was like a significant shift. He lives in Pennsylvania, and what did the guy find. 

231
00:30:29,013 --> 00:30:44,703
Jake Herwaldt: Oh, and just know, tomorrow when we talk on this convo, that that's the lens that we're talking to F&B, is like they wanted to do this, and they chose not to. So they're giving up on the lead, basically. So just be sensitive, basically.

232
00:30:45,263 --> 00:30:47,843
Nathan Bedford: They know it's not perfect.

233
00:30:48,083 --> 00:31:02,605
Jake Herwaldt: It doesn't sound like they were handcuffed to Salesforce, like they didn't want to be handcuffed. They would've been okay not. They wanted to rebuild it, but they are choosing to lose the opportunity. So we need to be sensitive. I mean, Paul didn't really say that, but...

234
00:31:02,605 --> 00:31:09,365
Nathan Bedford: It does, I mean, you guys don't think I'm reading this wrong, but it makes me wonder now, oh, was Steve kind of joking when he was saying it's AI, these guys aren't our first.

235
00:31:09,365 --> 00:31:09,925
Jake Herwaldt: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

236
00:31:10,405 --> 00:31:13,565
Nathan Bedford: It doesn't matter too much, we got it, but I'm just curious if...

237
00:31:13,565 --> 00:31:14,825
Jake Herwaldt: Not fully wrong, maybe.

238
00:31:15,045 --> 00:31:20,205
Nathan Bedford: I wonder if that was, yeah, like, they've had, these guys worked at Block for a while. They had a lot of reasons to...

239
00:31:20,205 --> 00:31:21,265
Jake Herwaldt: Yeah, if you would choose them...

240
00:31:21,265 --> 00:31:29,655
Nathan Bedford: There was a lot of reasons to potentially choose them. Like, the one challenge I would say is you want an outside perspective. These guys have been living in Salesforce for so long, I don't think they can provide what we didn't expect.

241
00:31:29,955 --> 00:31:36,535
Andrew Bailey: There's this part of me that's like, listen, how many times do I have to look at this crappy system for me to be like, well, you aren't here.

242
00:31:37,085 --> 00:31:41,645
Nathan Bedford: No, that's my thought. I know you had years, but I think if we were here for years, we would have probably made it better.

243
00:31:43,965 --> 00:31:55,985
Andrew Bailey: In months, in months, I made a much uglier system much better. And I'm not, this isn't a comparison, this is just like, meh. I was going to be sensitive either way because you're a person and I care about you. I'm not going to be sensitive because...

244
00:31:56,345 --> 00:31:59,845
Nathan Bedford: Yeah, I agree. Okay, so I'm almost done with the must-haves.

245
00:31:59,999 --> 00:32:00,879
Andrew Bailey: Scratch that from the recording.

246
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:09,589
Nathan Bedford: I'll be scrubbing this heavily. What are you doing? I thought it was tape.

247
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:13,429
Jake Herwaldt: It was. It was and then you started pulling it.

248
00:32:13,509 --> 00:32:24,229
Andrew Bailey: I literally was like, I'm going to do them a favor. I'm going to do them a favor and I'm going to take this tape off it for them. It's a monstrosity.

249
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:35,619
Nathan Bedford: Damn it. When your kids do this with less grace we'll know exactly why. My kids would do that too. What were you taking? It does look like tape on it. I was like, who put tape on it. 

250
00:32:35,659 --> 00:32:37,359
Jake Herwaldt: I hate tape on windows.

251
00:32:37,899 --> 00:33:04,861
Nathan Bedford: I'm going to fix this for them. Okay, notifications. I'm just going to read this out loud. You must receive a notification via email. Is this all about receiving them for all the things we know? Click through. Yeah, many of these are duplicated. This is all about receiving all the notifications when you need it. Vendors must know it's a warranty. Why now? And be prompted to provide that to them. All that just means they'll tell us exactly what to put in the email list.

252
00:33:04,921 --> 00:33:11,141
Jake Herwaldt: This will be, I know we've been playing with emails a lot, Nate, but this will be us, we'll want to really tighten it up.

253
00:33:11,341 --> 00:33:12,941
Nathan Bedford: I was going to say, what does that mean. 

254
00:33:13,101 --> 00:33:19,501
Jake Herwaldt: Well, I just feel like we've tried out a couple that were like, emails suck, but you found something recently that was really nice.

255
00:33:19,721 --> 00:33:26,941
Nathan Bedford: No, you found one in the last couple months. We've been playing with them because I've been experimenting, but when I was at Linko, I moved us from SendGrid to Postmark because they were so good.

256
00:33:27,201 --> 00:33:31,981
Jake Herwaldt: No, but I mean like using React instead of needing to do like all the weird HTML and all that garbage.

257
00:33:31,981 --> 00:33:32,981
Nathan Bedford: Oh, you mean the bodies of them.

258
00:33:32,981 --> 00:33:36,761
Jake Herwaldt: Yeah, yeah, sorry, that's what I meant. Not actually, not infrastructure.

259
00:33:37,061 --> 00:33:37,801
Nathan Bedford: Yes, no, I think.

260
00:33:37,801 --> 00:33:43,121
Jake Herwaldt: But I mean styling because you don't want it to look like garbage and you want it to look good on mobile or your iPad. No, you're right.

261
00:33:43,181 --> 00:33:44,941
Nathan Bedford: There's libraries and I've even thought this really.

262
00:33:45,101 --> 00:33:46,881
Jake Herwaldt: You found something, though, that played nice with React.

263
00:33:47,141 --> 00:33:47,501
Nathan Bedford: I did, yeah.

264
00:33:47,761 --> 00:33:48,281
Jake Herwaldt: Oh, okay.

265
00:33:48,401 --> 00:34:05,983
Nathan Bedford: Yeah, it was actually, I think it was recently. Either way, the truth is we probably want, the kinds of things that they might want to change frequently, we should make it easy for them to change. Like this is typically how you do this. Oh. Like we might eventually, eventually met an admin portal, they can go in and make very limited time.

266
00:34:06,143 --> 00:34:07,183
Jake Herwaldt: CRM almost, yeah.

267
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:18,303
Andrew Bailey: Wait real quick, what was that new email system that had a really nice marketing website that you tried, but you were going to Postmark? Recent? Yeah, over the last year.

268
00:34:18,543 --> 00:34:29,983
Nathan Bedford: Yeah, recent. Recent, yeah, you threw it my way. It was on my commenter app. They're good, Postmark has the best in class delivery. Recent is a bit cheaper. They're both good, but Postmark, that's the two that are probably good.

269
00:34:29,983 --> 00:34:32,863
Andrew Bailey: And they're both, they're like their API for everything.

270
00:34:33,063 --> 00:34:43,643
Nathan Bedford: Yeah, the biggest thing with Postmark is they have longer audit logs out of the box. So it's really nice to go back to, even if it didn't get delivered two weeks ago, I can see that, I can see more exactly why.

271
00:34:44,163 --> 00:34:47,343
Andrew Bailey: Why did Recent do anything that made them why commenter. 

272
00:34:47,863 --> 00:34:51,843
Nathan Bedford: They were more developer-first, that's what, they're like Stripe for email.

273
00:34:52,303 --> 00:34:52,663
Andrew Bailey: Gotcha.

274
00:34:52,743 --> 00:35:03,025
Nathan Bedford: And Postmark makes it easy for you to have templates inside of them. Postmark, why I like them is they put a ton of effort into, Cleaning their IP addresses, keeping them clean, keeping...

275
00:35:03,025 --> 00:35:03,585
Jake Herwaldt: So it delivers.

276
00:35:03,725 --> 00:35:04,865
Nathan Bedford: So delivery is just like...

277
00:35:04,865 --> 00:35:10,345
Andrew Bailey: So there's a little bit more professional experience versus like quick app experience.

278
00:35:10,465 --> 00:35:32,275
Nathan Bedford: Let's put it this way. Postmark on their website, they track their delivery to all the major platforms live. They say, in the last hour, we delivered two and a half seconds to Gmail. And then they show you the five top platforms. They track that metric. All right. I like that. That's sexy. Yeah. Okay. Then we have should haves. Frequently asked questions tab on. That's a good example where I'd love to make that frequently asked questions thing.

279
00:35:32,975 --> 00:35:33,735
Speaker 4: That's not a thing.

280
00:35:33,995 --> 00:35:38,115
Nathan Bedford: They can pull you up. Not a thing, ideally. But if they're going to change it, I don't want them to have to go through us.

281
00:35:38,335 --> 00:35:39,915
Andrew Bailey: Yeah. That should be a...

282
00:35:39,915 --> 00:35:42,455
Nathan Bedford: It's normally a CMS kind of thing. Is that right? Yeah.

283
00:35:43,075 --> 00:35:43,395
Jake Herwaldt: CRM. 

284
00:35:43,755 --> 00:35:47,445
Nathan Bedford: CMS. Content management stuff. Yeah. But we'll see what they have.

285
00:35:47,865 --> 00:35:50,115
Andrew Bailey: We've done a ton of that with stuff.

286
00:35:50,535 --> 00:36:09,799
Nathan Bedford: Vendors should be able to view their shopping cart from portal view. These feel like low-hanging fruit for even phase one. But let me read. Actually, they have descriptions for all these. Vendors should be able to view their shipping cut-off times from the portal view in SW on the home page so they can request edits.

287
00:36:09,899 --> 00:36:14,089
Jake Herwaldt: I don't fully know what that means. I think, does that mean the like, yeah, I don't know.

288
00:36:14,189 --> 00:36:19,449
Nathan Bedford: I think it's just a little bit of information that they want to flow through. This is a good example of high business value but low debt effort, I think.

289
00:36:19,529 --> 00:36:19,809
Speaker 4: Yeah.

290
00:36:20,819 --> 00:36:32,979
Nathan Bedford: I'll put it as phase one discuss. The ability for vendors to view all required items that are connected to a single record. We've talked about that one quite a bit. So, not just, this is the hero kit thing that Sam talked about. The question is, is that phase one or phase two? Because it should have.

291
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:35,159
Jake Herwaldt: The ability for vendors to view all records.

292
00:36:36,299 --> 00:36:44,859
Nathan Bedford: Right now, if I have a record with five different items, you will get five different requests. And you might not be able to see how they all connect together to the same request.

293
00:36:44,919 --> 00:36:46,199
Jake Herwaldt: Oh, I feel like we should.

294
00:36:46,279 --> 00:36:47,859
Nathan Bedford: I feel like we should. Yeah, I think so too.

295
00:36:47,959 --> 00:36:50,039
Jake Herwaldt: Because that's a UX thing, I feel like, right. 

296
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,579
Nathan Bedford: I don't think there's, I think if we're building from scratch, it'll be easier to build it that way.

297
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:54,799
Jake Herwaldt: Yeah, then we'll change it.

298
00:36:55,319 --> 00:37:29,221
Nathan Bedford: Yeah, I think. All right. Legal agreements to... For buyers, let's see, so not a debt requirement. Legal agreements for buyers, vendors, some sort of terms and conditions. This is definitely a phase two. This is like if they want their vendors to be able to upload their terms and conditions and not mandate. Vendors should be able to cancel a PO if they have no longer fulfilled. We just talked about that, right? This will auto-close stages and status to cancel. You must issue a notification to customers that it was canceled.

299
00:37:29,941 --> 00:37:35,461
Nathan Bedford: Was that pitched as a phase one, phase two? That's a new feature, by the way. Should we put that as, what do you guys think. 

300
00:37:35,561 --> 00:37:40,991
Jake Herwaldt: That's what auto-closed. I mean, they should be able to do that.

301
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:42,411
Nathan Bedford: I don't know why we wouldn't just do that.

302
00:37:42,791 --> 00:37:48,611
Jake Herwaldt: The problem is, can Salesforce support a canceled PO? Like, I don't know.

303
00:37:48,651 --> 00:37:50,891
Nathan Bedford: I don't know. I don't know how that works. I'll say phase one.

304
00:37:50,911 --> 00:37:55,191
Jake Herwaldt: Like, why else hasn't this been a feature? It's probably because.

305
00:37:55,331 --> 00:38:06,773
Nathan Bedford: I think, honestly, it's a lower priority thing. It's my guess, but you're right. It might be complicated. Last one in this list is if a vendor does not respond to an SRT within seven days, the record should automatically move to the tree.

306
00:38:06,773 --> 00:38:07,313
Jake Herwaldt: I hate this.

307
00:38:07,593 --> 00:38:08,973
Nathan Bedford: They put this everywhere.

308
00:38:11,023 --> 00:38:34,523
Jake Herwaldt: I hate this because I hate stuff auto-moving. If you want it to go into, like, no response or, like, hide it or, like, whatever, archive, like, you should archive it. I don't like the idea of personally, as a buyer, my parts, like, this is for a buyer and a vendor. This is talking about the vendor. But I don't like the idea of what happened to that order. Oh, it just disappeared. It's been seven days.

309
00:38:34,723 --> 00:38:37,823
Andrew Bailey: I wonder if they have to go into it to do that.

310
00:38:37,883 --> 00:38:39,283
Jake Herwaldt: No, she wants it auto.

311
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:45,423
Andrew Bailey: I know, I know, I know. But the current state is in order for the dark head, they have to go into it rather than just being a button.

312
00:38:45,483 --> 00:38:53,193
Jake Herwaldt: Yeah, like a market archive. I thought it was possibly already. Oh, maybe not. And he finishes Apple.

313
00:38:54,193 --> 00:39:14,595
Speaker 5: And the peanut hole jar of peanut butter. All right. And now you're. your ankle so you can just you're going to your quick this is bulking season i'm gonna do a dirty bulk and i'll get very strong i'm up 10 pounds break of the tailbone so you guys need anything.

314
00:39:15,065 --> 00:39:45,545
Jake Herwaldt: right now we're going through sam's long list of requirements okay just to make sure we've covered all of those items so and then some of the ones that we need more clarification on um to make sure that we feel good about phase one phase one's our focus and then post this i'm hoping that we can talk through what do we need to do to prepare for the fmd conversation for tomorrow so based on what we know because there's certain features in here where it's like hey it would be nice because she gave us must have nice to have could have type things some of these to us were like oh.

315
00:39:45,545 --> 00:40:09,619
Jake Herwaldt: that's so easy like canceling a po that's a button that's great but for fmd it's like that that must not be a thing that can happen today and is that because canceling a po is difficult and if that's so like we need these are conversations we need to start having, FMD is like from our stamp side a lot of this is low effort but that's because we're just going to be saying that hey Salesforce do the thing yeah and a lot.

316
00:40:09,619 --> 00:40:20,739
Speaker 5: of that cancel field will have no interaction with us was about 50% the volume is not we're not in control of the December control all right I'll be in here and so four o'clock okay.

317
00:40:20,739 --> 00:40:54,849
Nathan Bedford: okay I think listen then FMD is what I'm hoping okay let's do this real quick for you so this is on the SWP side of things must-haves I'm gonna do this one. is worth saying must-have fire must be able to be must be guided through the process like an on-screen tutorial I'm a little surprised with that but I guess I.

318
00:40:54,849 --> 00:40:58,469
Nathan Bedford: shouldn't be shocked on-screen tutorials and he built those before yeah there's a lot of yeah there's a lot of people.

319
00:40:58,909 --> 00:40:59,989
Jake Herwaldt: yeah and there's.

320
00:41:00,031 --> 00:41:04,051
Andrew Bailey: so many new ones all the time. We tried. Better than there were in 2018 with.

321
00:41:04,051 --> 00:41:10,251
Jake Herwaldt: Linko. Yeah. There was going to be one we were using for HSA. Driver? Yeah.

322
00:41:10,631 --> 00:41:14,091
Nathan Bedford: Multiple users under one account. That one we just need to talk about.

323
00:41:14,471 --> 00:41:20,991
Jake Herwaldt: Are you still thinking clerk or not clerk? Because clerk has organizations out of the box.

324
00:41:20,991 --> 00:41:24,892
Nathan Bedford: It probably won't be clerk because of some of their specific requirements around security.

325
00:41:25,292 --> 00:41:27,771
Andrew Bailey: Isn't there a new company that's coming or are you looking at an older one. 

326
00:41:27,771 --> 00:41:34,711
Nathan Bedford: No, the one when I built the tracking for the audio thing, that was using WorkOS, which is one I probably would.

327
00:41:35,191 --> 00:41:38,091
Jake Herwaldt: Does it have orgs out of the box? It does have orgs.

328
00:41:39,471 --> 00:42:08,663
Nathan Bedford: Do we not want to get handcuffed? This actually is the one where we need, I'm going to see, I'm going to put a discuss on that. So with Tom, with Mark specifically. Because this is all super easy if they, if we don't have to get into individual single sign-on connections with each org. Which I know they want in the future, but it's not right now. Like, you know, like with, Yeah, it's SAML or it's OpenID, but they're both like, they're auth providers, and there's some pricing considerations.

329
00:42:12,444 --> 00:42:40,513
Nathan Bedford: There's so few users. Yeah, right, that's part of the problem is there's so few users that, and they're telling them look at, like WorkOS makes it really easy, but they charge for the Oregon operating system. If you use the custom SAML options. Anyways, I think just having that discussion probably isn't, I'll ask them from a feature perspective, unless a lot of this is in the voice chat.

330
00:42:42,334 --> 00:42:51,074
Jake Herwaldt: I've done my things for Tina to do, but we didn't have our sync, so we're going to see if, it's going to get done this week. If it's not already done, let me tell you.

331
00:43:09,556 --> 00:43:16,716
Nathan Bedford: So they have, I'll put this down, search by part number or description and I thought they made a big effort of saying we shouldn't let them search by description.

332
00:43:18,306 --> 00:43:19,946
Andrew Bailey: Yes, do not let them search by description.

333
00:43:20,186 --> 00:43:27,946
Nathan Bedford: That's what they said. I'm going to trust they know the users better. I'm like why wouldn't you want that ability? Unless it gets in the way, which maybe it does.

334
00:43:28,526 --> 00:43:36,426
Andrew Bailey: I think that we can start with that. What they don't want is that search, they have a separate field that searches by description currently.

335
00:43:37,596 --> 00:43:38,616
Nathan Bedford: That's what they don't want.

336
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:49,776
Andrew Bailey: Yeah, do you remember the old dealer circle? It was like 17 search fields. Oh, yeah. So they don't want that, but I think they wanted just a fuzzy search ID.

337
00:43:51,096 --> 00:43:52,216
Nathan Bedford: Okay, let's go with that.

338
00:43:54,406 --> 00:43:56,726
Andrew Bailey: We can put a secret control K in there.

339
00:43:57,646 --> 00:44:21,770
Nathan Bedford: I think we probably shouldn't anyways. I just think there's so many things too that you're gonna blow their mind with just like this fuzzy search that yeah I'm hoping like we'll have to regulate the thing yeah it'd be easy that's why I'm curious what things they really want to go deep in so we make sure you build their minds on that one yeah like.

340
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:39,180
Jake Herwaldt: resetting their passwords like that one we should probably blow their mind on that one that's the problem if you if you say one feature to blow their mind they're gonna like say something you know all right assuming we get what's your second feature can you try again yeah yeah I'm realizing there's a lot of.

341
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:53,460
Nathan Bedford: requirements here that we'll have to extract out that aren't in here this doesn't really even talk yet about like there actually is it probably an overlap there's a difference between this and the original list this isn't talking about any synchronization of Salesforce which we know is yeah it's.

342
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,660
Jake Herwaldt: just assuming I'm behind this right which is if we're actually building out.

343
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:08,652
Nathan Bedford: like the menu we're gonna have to have like like when you when you install you're gonna have to have like like when you install, something on your computer and it's like, oh, it's just taken up this much. That's what is going to happen with a Salesforce integration. Some things are just, we have to do them. Here's what's left in the menu.

344
00:45:08,712 --> 00:45:26,252
Jake Herwaldt: And I think that's kind of, unfortunately, our job, probably, is to get with FMD and say, okay, what out of the box can we just, like, do you assume FMD right now just has these routes and stuff that they can then expose to us? Or do you think that this is all brand new work they're going to have to do. 

345
00:45:27,492 --> 00:45:31,552
Andrew Bailey: Do you think that they're going to need, we're going to need from them. 

346
00:45:31,612 --> 00:45:36,392
Jake Herwaldt: Everything. Anything we're doing, it needs to be, like, hitting Salesforce.

347
00:45:37,012 --> 00:45:56,512
Andrew Bailey: No, because it's separate. Their integration needs to hit Salesforce eventually. But we're going to have, we own the customer data. We own the vendor data. We own the master parts list. It's our quote for the external piece because it is eventually being fully pulled. Like, there isn't really that much.

348
00:45:57,462 --> 00:46:03,064
Jake Herwaldt: Yeah, but. If your vendor. is blocked, that needs to trigger a Salesforce thing.

349
00:46:03,324 --> 00:46:03,684
Andrew Bailey: Sure.

350
00:46:05,044 --> 00:46:21,474
Jake Herwaldt: If you are a vendor and you are asking block for a thing, that needs to trigger Salesforce. Anything that hits block, either vendor or buyer, needs to call Salesforce because they don't currently use the system. Do you get what I'm saying. 

351
00:46:21,594 --> 00:46:29,684
Andrew Bailey: Yeah, I do. But is that, is making, maybe that's something, a distinction we make is that we can actually get a quicker external.

352
00:46:29,684 --> 00:46:49,874
Jake Herwaldt: And then there's these questions of like cleaning the parts list. Like, is that an Avoda action or is that, hey, you have someone. That's a good example of something we need to call out. Yeah, because like if you tell us, there's one assumption of you give us a list. That's low effort. If you are now asking us to learn how to clean your data, that's a lot more effort.

353
00:46:49,974 --> 00:47:04,806
Nathan Bedford: Yeah. We have 45 minutes before we leave Steve. Okay. And so to answer the, real quickly, Salesforce, think about it more like we're not going to have, it's not going to expose APIs. It's just Salesforce is a big bucket of data that you can subscribe to.

354
00:47:05,816 --> 00:47:12,176
Jake Herwaldt: Database tables. Okay, and so and hit with and hit with requests. Oh, so it's just one thing.

355
00:47:12,176 --> 00:47:21,456
Nathan Bedford: I think it's primarily crud actions on database tables. Oh That's like that's really there's probably some workflows they can put in the middle of some of them Yeah.

356
00:47:21,456 --> 00:47:27,556
Jake Herwaldt: But we're just not hoping that they're looking at these like looking at changes to trigger some of their magic.

357
00:47:27,556 --> 00:47:48,276
Nathan Bedford: Well that and that's where we need to find out precise I believe the way that Salesforce is built out is that you have like kind of listeners for database to changes So wherever it's changed it triggers up a workflow if it means, Confirms whether I'm right or whether there is individual API created for specific things I guess that probably it won't matter a ton to us either way in the sense that we'll just call something.

358
00:47:49,376 --> 00:47:51,216
Andrew Bailey: I'm trying to imagine how it was built.

359
00:47:51,216 --> 00:48:12,150
Nathan Bedford: But yeah, certainly when it comes to us, you know, if I have changes we're subscribing to a Salesforce event, And then If I Just have a we push things back, of the intercept to do their workflow. But it's a very self-sourced question. So, auto-archiving requests, that's your favorite one. Cool. I hate that one. Do you, okay, fine.

360
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:20,160
Jake Herwaldt: Am I crazy in that? Do you like the idea of stuff moving by itself? I think what I'm- Do you like your emails auto-archiving. 

361
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:49,510
Nathan Bedford: Is, it depends on what it's there for. Like, if it's something that, if I know that the only reason they ever show up there is if someone just forgot to close it, then I don't mind. So it totally depends on the work. But I think for people that are intentional about their actions, they're like, yeah, I left it there for a reason, don't do that. So, it tells me more about how they process. All right, let's go. Click and revert to see all the requests there. And let's them see that one of those parts.

362
00:48:49,510 --> 00:49:03,242
Speaker 4: is in my breath. Request to see all S or T. to do a quick select of choice.

363
00:49:09,082 --> 00:49:29,302
Nathan Bedford: There's nothing in here about an audit journal that we'll need to have, that they should have. So there's probably the things they said they want, and then we'll propose, we'll say here's the things that are the baseline features, and we'll say here are the things that really you should have. Like the ability to see a full audit list of everything that happened on a rec order. That's probably there on the right side already, but we'll need to add that.

364
00:49:29,402 --> 00:49:31,262
Jake Herwaldt: They didn't actually ask for it. No, it's not. Yeah, they said.

365
00:49:31,262 --> 00:49:35,202
Nathan Bedford: they'd put it there. I saw something on the right side that was somewhere. But you can't.

366
00:49:35,202 --> 00:49:45,132
Jake Herwaldt: like when it leaves and comes back, right? Anything like that? Because that's what Sam was freaking out about, that she went to some place, a parts master.

367
00:49:45,132 --> 00:49:49,612
Andrew Bailey: or something. Can you explain to me again? The idea, a timeline.

368
00:49:49,612 --> 00:50:19,834
Jake Herwaldt: of a part. You know how you said like parts over everything? Sam was saying you cannot right now in Salesforce, there's not like one screen to see what has all... happen to that part over its life yeah yeah because like imagine you it's you quoted it you bought it you shipped it it got rma'd back you fixed it you shipped it to some new customer there's nowhere to like you can look up that part and just see that the story um i just went.

369
00:50:19,834 --> 00:50:51,534
Nathan Bedford: on flag i'll upload this or google drive when i'm done so we can mark it up um but easy logging fruit for ai advantage during the chatter you shouldn't be able to upload a po so they just have a band instead of don't upload views obviously we use a little bit of a scan and say it's a little bit maybe you shouldn't do this yeah it's a common user mistake and currently, um breaks the entire connection so i don't know what that means but we won't do that, um yeah make sure that everything else is your record obviously um editor so see.

370
00:50:51,534 --> 00:51:09,026
Nathan Bedford: carton doing so much confirmed quantity and purchase very workflow specific. i think just there's so many of these i'm going to skip over it because we know it just means we'll have to talk with you about how you want what you want to do minor stuff like that though.

371
00:51:09,026 --> 00:51:20,266
Jake Herwaldt: me like is there certain things we need to have the customers opt into if we're going to process their document like i'm even thinking like are those things we need to put on our radar to have.

372
00:51:20,266 --> 00:51:55,246
Nathan Bedford: them we should confirm it because somebody should confirm that it's not breaking anything but i we should confirm it yeah yeah i've not seen that be a problem yet but i think we should, do this probably is where if we get that draw to sign off we'll get lots of help on that so see checkout page must include list of tncs for purchasing parts get recap check out this is all a checkout page just your basic checkout page okay then there's the options we've already seen hard copy po manual set up guys that from a buyer's standpoint was yeah.

373
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,780
Jake Herwaldt: In parentheses, you should put, this is a sticky note.

374
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:21,780
Nathan Bedford: One thing that's helpful with this is maybe he's trying to help us with the did we or didn't we satisfy David? Yeah, yeah.

375
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:35,420
Speaker 4: This is your complete QR code attachment. Thank you. This issue came back from a page that's like a court history.

376
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:40,180
Jake Herwaldt: Are you guys feeling like we need to adjust our budget for phase one. 

377
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:42,090
Nathan Bedford: I don't, I would.

378
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:43,650
Jake Herwaldt: Phase one is too early.

379
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:48,990
Nathan Bedford: It's too early. No, I mean, obviously, if anything, it would go down. So I'd say we won't put stuff in.

380
00:52:50,310 --> 00:53:05,482
Andrew Bailey: Yeah, I would rather use the budget and expand the breadth of impact. I'm excited to show how much we are capable. I'm excited to have the space to like.

381
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:15,072
Jake Herwaldt: create a design system, have design reviews, go through like mocks and then where we just don't really normally have that budget. Last one in this category.

382
00:53:15,592 --> 00:53:31,162
Nathan Bedford: customers be able to initiate warranty replacement or off the original work, that's like a yes or no but we don't really know what that that's going to be the whole process. It's underspecified I would say. We can easily initiate that what does it mean once you click that button? What happens after you click that button. 

383
00:53:31,972 --> 00:53:46,922
Jake Herwaldt: Oh yeah because they talked about a drop-down of you need to be able to say how long it can warranty for and then they like the idea of you coming back in and being like I want to enact the warranty but like but then what. 

384
00:53:47,522 --> 00:54:01,564
Nathan Bedford: Yeah yeah that's okay so I put that as a phase one discuss because I think you need to know be able to initiate is one thing but that's what's one funny is nothing else that's in this list is and here's what the warranty process is supposed to do. So we're super detailed in all the other questions. This just says, kick it off.

385
00:54:02,684 --> 00:54:14,954
Andrew Bailey: Yeah, I guess that would be, the vendor would have a record that basically said, you know, a warranty has been triggered on this part, and it would create a new interaction.

386
00:54:16,884 --> 00:54:47,474
Jake Herwaldt: And do you think they ever plan on being like the middleman, like Amazon is with deliveries, where it's like, hey, my package says it was delivered, but it never showed up, and then Amazon will, like, refund you? Like, do they plan on doing that kind of stuff, where it's like, hey, I wanted a warranty, but your vendor's being a jerk. And it's like, well, you opted into that vendor. That's the other weird thing, is like the current system of, like, an onboarding a vendor or a supplier. Like, say I'm a new vendor.

387
00:54:47,954 --> 00:54:55,494
Jake Herwaldt: How do I get all of your buyers to now know that I'm available on this platform? Can you put that actually as a question. 

388
00:54:55,594 --> 00:54:55,974
Nathan Bedford: What was it. 

389
00:54:55,974 --> 00:55:15,326
Jake Herwaldt: If you're a new vendor or a new buyer, how do I, when I add... am added to the system how do I notify all buyers that I'm now a new vendor on the scene you know what I mean because you have to tell us who your preferred vendors are but what if I just don't know who you have in your system yeah I.

390
00:55:16,086 --> 00:55:18,846
Nathan Bedford: wonder if since they said the small community they have like outside of this.

391
00:55:18,846 --> 00:55:22,246
Jake Herwaldt: process means oh that's right yeah that's true they might just be like it's.

392
00:55:22,246 --> 00:55:52,716
Nathan Bedford: the 12 people you might just order pizza people like Steve did like that's so smart your classic sales guy yep okay so more if the customer let's see the, customer doing indicated the purchase but process the order outside of the portal that's out of the portal this is probably the admins of currently customers customer has access and it has to add SRC to cart and check out then requiring them to upload a PO and submit many large hospitals have completely separate teams or automated systems that will generate the PO and send them we.

393
00:55:52,716 --> 00:56:05,420
Nathan Bedford: need a solution to allow for us to sell information but not require the sending of the PO to the players so there's I'm reading that as a, We need a little bit more info, but in general, there's some nuances to the PO and the checkout process.

394
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:15,540
Jake Herwaldt: Basically, just like, let me submit without a PO. Yeah, it's like... But that seems like it's a person-specific. That sounds like that's a vendor or a buyer-specific thing.

395
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:18,940
Nathan Bedford: This is under should have, so we could mark it as phase two unless they want to bring it in.

396
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:27,130
Jake Herwaldt: That's why I think that we should keep a bucket of things that we say are phase two, that if we have time, we pull in.

397
00:56:27,410 --> 00:56:36,910
Andrew Bailey: Yeah, the question would be, so if we don't do a phase one, it just means that there's some customer who does the PO and then this thing sitting out there in the big deal.

398
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:56,280
Jake Herwaldt: Which is how they currently get, because I feel like what you do is you create an ability to have a certain special buyer who's not required to bring in a PO. Yeah, I guess. Dude, we need to talk a whole lot about admin.

399
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:58,540
Nathan Bedford: Like as in like...

400
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:06,892
Jake Herwaldt: Admin within this. within this tool admin within like they don't they don't define that stuff at all we just glaze over all of that yeah.

401
00:57:06,892 --> 00:57:08,352
Nathan Bedford: which right now.

402
00:57:08,352 --> 00:57:10,432
Jake Herwaldt: everything they do is in salesforce they now.

403
00:57:10,432 --> 00:57:11,292
Nathan Bedford: no it's true.

404
00:57:11,292 --> 00:57:11,932
Jake Herwaldt: not even.

405
00:57:11,932 --> 00:57:21,832
Nathan Bedford: like even what those look like I think yeah part of that I'm remembering like these in-person meetings are great for fast bandwidth communication but we're going to have follow-ups next week.

406
00:57:21,832 --> 00:57:22,332
Speaker 4: yeah yeah yeah.

407
00:57:22,332 --> 00:57:52,212
Nathan Bedford: and some of that will be what are all the master data tables that you have in salesforce that feed into this like vendors what should a vendor screen look like we'll have to reproduce it you know what is your capabilities, like you have to add new capabilities you have to track whenever they change all those admin portal pages, that's it for I'm going to upload this but that's it for what we had you need to get out of it so it doesn't yell yeah, we got about half an hour before I think yep.

408
00:57:52,792 --> 00:57:58,482
Jake Herwaldt: do we want to talk about, FMD with him, or is that just a five minute combo are you thinking.

409
00:57:58,902 --> 00:58:05,624
Nathan Bedford: um the, That's like just seeing what he, I mean, asking what he's essentially expecting tomorrow to cover. Is that what you're thinking. 

410
00:58:06,754 --> 00:58:15,524
Jake Herwaldt: I want to, I want to just go in with a plan.

411
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:17,404
Andrew Bailey: They said we were heading shoulders above.

412
00:58:19,424 --> 00:58:23,584
Nathan Bedford: That was probably before FMD pulled out. Are you talking about FMD as in what's the point of tomorrow's meeting. 

413
00:58:23,744 --> 00:58:32,244
Jake Herwaldt: I just want to go in with a plan to make sure that when we talk to FMD, mostly you, Nate, are like, here's all the, like, butt sniffing.

414
00:58:33,344 --> 00:58:35,744
Nathan Bedford: Yeah, that's what I like to do.

415
00:58:35,744 --> 00:58:49,394
Jake Herwaldt: It's like dogs, you know, they just sniff butts. That's all I do. I just got on LinkedIn a buddy of mine from high school just tried to connect with me. He is currently a people ops specialist at BrainVue.

416
00:58:50,274 --> 00:58:51,154
Speaker 4: What was his name. 

417
00:58:51,314 --> 00:58:59,384
Jake Herwaldt: Well, he must be new. His name is Kyle Kruzniak. Are they at Grand Rapids Company. 

418
00:58:59,624 --> 00:58:59,884
Speaker 4: Yeah.

419
00:59:00,136 --> 00:59:01,176
Jake Herwaldt: Oh, I didn't know that.

420
00:59:03,916 --> 00:59:16,376
Andrew Bailey: They are, most of them are in Texas now, but they started two guys. One guy was from Jackson. Another guy was from Great Rampage, Matt Shaver. Those are the two owners.

421
