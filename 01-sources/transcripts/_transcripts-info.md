# Transcripts Folder Documentation

## Purpose
Contains recordings, transcripts, and notes from discovery sessions with the client.
These materials capture real user feedback, pain points, workflow demonstrations, and
clarifications that inform our understanding beyond the formal requirements. This is
where the "voice of the customer" lives.

- **Usage**: Reference for clarification, tone, and context

### Transcript Files
- **Format**: .txt, .docx (auto-generated and cleaned)
- **Purpose**: Searchable text of discussions
- **Processing**: AI-generated with manual corrections

### Summary Documents
- **Format**: .md (markdown summaries)
- **Contents**: Key points, decisions, action items
- **Structure**: Topics, insights, requirements identified

### Visual Materials
- **Format**: .pdf, .png (slides, diagrams, screenshots)
- **Purpose**: Workflow diagrams, system screenshots
- **Usage**: Visual reference for current processes

## Key Discoveries from Transcripts

### Process Insights
- Current system requires 15+ steps for simple orders
- Buyers spend 60% of time on vendor communication
- Vendors manage 5-7 different customer portals
- Excel is primary tool for 80% of processes

### Pain Points Identified
- **Buyers**: Manual data entry, lack of visibility, slow responses
- **Vendors**: Unclear requirements, multiple systems, payment delays
- **Integrated**: API limitations, data synchronization, error handling

### Requirements Clarifications
- Many "Must Have" requirements are workarounds for current issues
- Several undocumented requirements discovered
- Priority shifts based on actual user workflows
- Integration requirements more complex than RFP indicated

## Relationships to Other Folders

### Informs
- `/03-outputs/workflows/`: Real process flows from user demonstrations
- `/03-outputs/epics/`, `/03-outputs/features/`, `/03-outputs/stories/`: Priority and scope decisions
- `/03-outputs/personas/`: Persona pain points and goals
- `/02-analysis/requirements/`: Gap identification and requirement interpretation
- `/02-analysis/insights/`: Cross-session patterns and discovery themes

### Validates
- `/01-sources/client-requirements/`: Requirement interpretations and context
- `/01-sources/rfp-responses/`: Assumption validation and commitment verification

## Usage Patterns

### For Requirement Clarification
1. Search transcripts for requirement discussion
2. Review context and user explanation
3. Note any variations from written requirements
4. Document interpretation decisions

### For Workflow Design
1. Review session demonstrations
2. Extract actual vs. documented processes
3. Identify automation opportunities
4. Design improvements based on pain points

### For Priority Decisions
1. Count frequency of pain point mentions
2. Assess impact on daily operations
3. Weight by user importance
4. Prioritize solutions accordingly

## Search Index (Key Topics)
- "Excel" - Current tooling and migration needs
- "Email" - Communication workflows
- "Approval" - Authorization processes
- "Integration" - System connectivity requirements
- "Manual" - Automation opportunities
- "Visibility" - Status tracking needs
- "Report" - Analytics requirements

## Maintenance Notes
- Add new session folders with date prefix (YYYYMMDD)
- Create summary document for each session
- Tag key insights for easy searching
- Link discoveries to requirements and workflows
- Preserve original recordings for reference

## Privacy Considerations
- Recordings may contain confidential information
- Participant names should be anonymized in summaries
- Company-specific details require protection
- Distribution limited to project team

## Value Extraction Process
1. **Transcription**: Convert audio to searchable text
2. **Summarization**: Extract key points and decisions
3. **Insight Mining**: Identify patterns and pain points
4. **Requirement Mapping**: Link to formal requirements
5. **Action Items**: Create tasks from discoveries

## Next Steps
1. Complete summarization of all sessions
2. Create cross-session insight analysis
3. Map all discoveries to requirements
4. Generate pain point priority matrix
5. Schedule follow-up clarification sessions
