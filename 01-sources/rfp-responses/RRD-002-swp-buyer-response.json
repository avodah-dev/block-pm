This includes natural language support for answering questions, AI agents that can execute multi-step workflows, and smart suggestions based on user patterns. As a differentiator, we've built custom AI-powered voice agents accessible through phone calls - imagine field engineers checking order status or sending messages to vendors hands-free while working on equipment. The AI will complement the simplified interface by handling complex scenarios behind the scenes. We'll work with you to find the right fit for your budget and users' needs."

      "description": "Buyers need the ability to request installation quotes and technical support services directly related to the parts they've purchased through the platform. Currently, there's a gap between purchasing critical equipment like X-ray tubes and getting the professional services needed to install and calibrate them properly. Buyers often need installation quotes that include engineer availability, site visit costs, and timeframes. They also need flexible tech support options - whether that's scheduling a call before installation for planning, getting live assistance during installation for calibrations, or arranging follow-up support after installation is complete.",

      "how_we_deliver": "We'll build service request functionality that connects directly to purchased parts, allowing buyers to request installation quotes and schedule technical support calls specific to their orders. The system will enable buyers to request installation quotes that include engineer availability, site visit costs, and installation timeframes. For tech support, buyers can schedule calls before installation (for planning), during installation (for live assistance with calibrations), or after installation (for follow-up support). All service requests will be tied to specific purchase records, ensuring support teams have complete context about the parts and equipment involved. We'll route requests to appropriate service providers - Block's internal teams or qualified vendor partners - and provide communication tools for coordinating service delivery."

      "description": "Large hospital systems need to integrate with their existing CMMS platforms like Nuvolo. Having to operate in both their CMMS and your sourcing tool separately is a pain point - ideally the systems would handle the integrations so users don't have to work in two places. This represents a significant opportunity to streamline workflows for enterprise customers who've invested heavily in their maintenance management infrastructure.",

      "avodah_response": "",
      "how_we_deliver": "We'll leverage the proven architecture we're building for Sourcing Window Pro - where Block Imaging integrates like any other vendor and customer - to create a robust API framework for external CMMS platforms. By developing a standard interface that already handles the complexity of vendor-buyer relationships, we'll make it straightforward to connect with systems like Nuvolo and others. We'll start by interviewing enterprise customers to understand their specific integration needs, then offer both heavy integrations (full bi-directional sync) and light integrations (basic data exchange) as upgraded access features. The beauty of this approach is that we're not building something special just for CMMS - we're extending the same clean API architecture that makes the entire platform work."
