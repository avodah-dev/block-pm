# RFP Responses Folder Documentation

## Purpose
Contains Avodah's original RFP response documents submitted before the discovery process began. These pre-discovery responses represent our initial understanding and commitments, serving as a critical baseline for measuring scope evolution and ensuring we fulfill original promises while incorporating new discoveries.

## Core Files

### RRD-001-sw-vendor-response.json
- **Purpose**: Response to vendor-side requirements (CAD-002)
- **Requirements Addressed**: 25 of 57 vendor requirements
- **Structure**: Hierarchical JSON with requirement ID mappings
- **Key Sections**: Authentication, catalog management, quoting, messaging
- **Status**: Pre-discovery baseline response

### RRD-002-swp-buyer-response.json
- **Purpose**: Response to buyer-side requirements (CAD-001)
- **Requirements Addressed**: 26 of 61 buyer requirements
- **Structure**: Hierarchical JSON with requirement ID mappings
- **Key Sections**: Parts request, vendor selection, order management
- **Status**: Pre-discovery baseline response

### index.json
- **Purpose**: Catalog of all RFP response documents
- **Format**: JSON array with document metadata
- **Fields**: id, title, source_cad, requirements_addressed, date_created
- **Usage**: Quick lookup and navigation of response documents

## Document Structure

Each RRD (RFP Response Document) follows this format:
```json
{
  "id": "RRD-XXX",
  "addresses": ["CAD-XXX"],
  "requirements": {
    "REQ-ID": {
      "addressed": true/false,
      "response": "How we address this",
      "variation": "Any differences from request"
    }
  }
}
```

## Relationships to Other Folders

### Sources From
- `/01-sources/client-requirements/`: Original requirements being responded to
  - CAD-001 → RRD-002 (buyer requirements)
  - CAD-002 → RRD-001 (vendor requirements)

### Referenced By
- `/02-analysis/requirements/`: Gap analysis compares these responses to requirements
- `/03-outputs/epics/`, `/03-outputs/features/`, `/03-outputs/stories/`: Development plans based on commitments
- `/03-outputs/workflows/`: Workflow design informed by response commitments
- `/02-analysis/mappings/`: Traceability matrices track response-to-implementation links

## Usage Patterns

### For Commitment Tracking
1. Look up specific requirement response in RRD files
2. Compare commitment to actual discovery findings
3. Identify variations between promise and reality
4. Document in gap analysis

### For Development Planning
1. Review addressed requirements in RRD files
2. Extract specific commitments made
3. Translate to epics and features
4. Ensure development covers all promises

## Important Context
- **Pre-Discovery**: These responses predate discovery sessions
- **Coverage**: Only 43.2% of requirements addressed initially
- **Evolution**: Discovery sessions revealed additional complexity
- **Gaps**: Many requirements not addressed in original RFP
- **Purpose**: Baseline for measuring scope changes

## Maintenance Notes
- These are historical documents - do not modify content
- Use for reference and comparison only
- Any updates go in new RFP response documents
- Keep index.json current if new response docs added
- Document variations discovered during implementation

## Key Insights
- Original responses were conservative in scope
- Discovery revealed many unstated requirements
- Integration requirements were underestimated
- Workflow complexity not fully captured initially
