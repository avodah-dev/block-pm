      "how_we_deliver": "Build a T&C management area where vendors upload their terms with version tracking and effective dates. Create customer acknowledgment workflows that capture digital consent before order completion, showing exactly which version was agreed to. Include exception handling for customers who need special terms, audit trails for compliance, and integration with order history so everyone knows which terms apply to each transaction."
