# Requirements Management System Roadmap

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Foundation (Complete)

### Discovery & Analysis
- Captured 118 requirements from Block RFP
- Conducted 3-day discovery sessions with users
- Documented 9 workflows bridging user needs to development
- Generated epic/feature/story breakdown with 87.3% requirement coverage
- Identified 42 discovery-driven stories (26% of total) beyond original requirements

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 2: Initial EFS Generation (Complete - September 26, 2025)

### Completed Activities
- **EFS Generation**: 13 epics, 40 features, 160 stories created from workflows
- **Traceability Matrix**: Complete mapping showing 87.3% requirement coverage
- **Gap Analysis**: Identified 15 uncovered requirements (mainly warranty management)
- **Discovery Validation**: Confirmed 42 stories address needs beyond written requirements
- **Process Documentation**: Created reusable agent tasks for:
  - Epic detail generation
  - CSV export for Excel/MIRO stickies
  - Story enrichment with full attributes
- **Initial Review Artifacts**:
  - Created epic-overview.md with all 13 epics
  - Generated detailed e01-request-management.md and e04-order-fulfillment.md
  - Exported epic-feature-story-stickies.csv for visual planning

### Current Accuracy Assessment
- **Epics**: ~100% accurate (well-aligned with business needs)
- **Features**: ~90% accurate (minor adjustments expected)
- **Stories**: ~70% accurate (needs transcript validation and refinement)

## üìç Phase 3: Transcript-Driven Refinement (Current - Late September 2025)

### üîÑ In Progress
- **MIRO Timeline Mapping**: Using sticky note exports to visualize project phases
- **Initial Epic Reviews**: Testing review format with E01 and E04

### üìã Immediate Next Steps

#### 3.1 Transcript Indexing Process (Next Week)
1. **Build Transcript Index**:
   - Create process to analyze discovery transcripts (Day 1-3)
   - Map transcript segments to specific epics/features
   - Generate index file: transcript ‚Üí epic/feature references
   - Identify discussion themes not captured in current stories

2. **Index Output Format**:
   ```
   Transcript: 20250908-discovery-day01/session-2.md
   - E01/F01: Parts search discussion (timestamps)
   - E05/F13: EMA messaging requirements (timestamps)
   - Uncategorized: Voice-to-text idea (timestamp)
   ```

#### 3.2 Epic-by-Epic Refinement (October 2025)
For each epic (starting with highest value):
1. **Baseline Review**:
   - Start with current features (90% accurate)
   - Review against workflows
   - Check original requirements coverage

2. **Transcript Enhancement**:
   - Pull relevant transcript segments for epic
   - Identify missing stories or features
   - Capture specific examples and edge cases
   - Note Block-specific terminology and processes

3. **Story Generation**:
   - Refine existing stories (from 70% to 95% accuracy)
   - Add new stories from transcript insights
   - Apply full story attributes (persona, phase, points)
   - Create acceptance criteria

#### 3.3 Collaborative Review Process
1. **CSV Export for Human Review**:
   - Generate epic-specific CSV with all stories
   - Include columns for: Priority, Size, Risk, Comments
   - Share with stakeholders for offline review

2. **Recorded Review Sessions**:
   - Schedule epic review meetings
   - Walk through stories collaboratively
   - Record sessions for reference
   - Capture decisions and modifications

3. **Final Updates**:
   - Incorporate review feedback
   - Update story attributes based on discussion
   - Finalize acceptance criteria
   - Mark epic as "Review Complete"

## üéØ Phase 4: Story Finalization (November 2025)

### Complete Story Development
- Apply all feedback from collaborative reviews
- Ensure 95%+ accuracy for all stories
- Add technical specifications where needed
- Validate architectural alignment

### Prioritization & Phasing
- Classify stories: MVP, Phase 1, Phase 2, Future
- Identify technical dependencies
- Create implementation sequence
- Risk assessment for complex stories

### Documentation Completion
- Move all epics from /drafts to /epics
- Generate final traceability reports
- Create executive summary of scope
- Prepare handoff documentation

---

## üöÄ Phase 5: Implementation Planning (December 2025)

### Project Management Setup
- Export finalized stories to Linear/JIRA
- Configure boards and workflows
- Set up reporting dashboards
- Establish velocity tracking

### Technical Preparation
- API contract definitions from stories
- Database schema from data requirements
- Infrastructure sizing from performance criteria
- Integration specifications

### Sprint Planning
- Map stories to 2-week sprints
- Define MVP release scope
- Assign team resources
- Create release timeline

---

## üí° Phase 6: Development & Delivery (January 2026+)

### Execution
- Sprint-based development
- Continuous stakeholder demos
- Regular requirement validation
- Iterative refinement based on feedback

### Quality Assurance
- Acceptance criteria verification
- Requirements traceability testing
- User acceptance testing
- Performance validation

---

## Process Improvements Implemented

### Tooling & Artifacts
- **Agent Tasks**: Reusable processes for consistent artifact generation
- **CSV Exports**: Bridge between documentation and visual planning tools
- **Enrichment Process**: Systematic way to add detail to stories
- **Transcript Index**: New process to mine discovery sessions for requirements

### Quality Gates
- Features must be 90%+ accurate before story generation
- Stories require transcript validation to reach 95% accuracy
- Each epic gets collaborative review before finalization
- Recording reviews ensures decision documentation

### Efficiency Gains
- Reusable agent tasks reduce regeneration time by 75%
- CSV exports enable parallel stakeholder review
- Transcript indexing prevents requirement miss
- MIRO visualization accelerates timeline planning
